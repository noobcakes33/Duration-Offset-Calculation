take
it
away
thank
you
madam
chair
as
you
may
all
recall
the
county
did
declare
the
month
of
june
pride
month
and
we
have
drawn
special
attention
as
we
can
each
week
to
members
of
the
LGBTQ
plus
community
today
we
are
honoring
the
trevor
project
by
even
the
lowest
estimate
lesbian
gay
bisexual
transgender
queer
and
questioning
youth
are
up
to
four
times
more
likely
to
attempt
suicide
than
their
heterosexual
peers
LGBTQ
plus
youth
who
come
from
a
rejecting
family
are
up
to
nine
times
more
likely
to
attempt
suicide
then
those
in
their
age
group
who
are
heterosexual
twenty
years
ago
an
academy
award
winning
short
film
trevor
aired
on
HBO
a
gay
thirteen
year
old
boy
rejected
by
his
friends
because
of
his
sexuality
tried
to
commit
suicide
sadly
it
wasn't
an
uncommon
story
at
that
time
and
it's
not
uncommon
today
for
suicidal
LGBTQ
plus
youth
to
have
no
place
to
turn
when
they're
in
crisis
but
it
is
less
likely
today
because
the
film
makers
decided
to
form
an
organization
to
promote
acceptance
of
our
youth
and
to
aid
them
and
their
peers
their
friends
their
families
in
crisis
and
suicide
prevention
the
trevor
project
is
the
leading
national
organization
providing
crisis
intervention
and
suicide
prevention
services
to
lesbian
gay
bisexual
transgender
queer
and
questioning
young
people
under
the
age
of
twenty
five
they
offer
guidance
and
resources
also
to
parents
and
educators
in
order
to
foster
safe
accepting
and
inclusive
environments
for
all
youth
at
home
and
it's
cool
they
operate
the
trevor
lifeline
a
toll
free
telephone
number
operated
by
trained
volunteers
and
it
was
the
very
first
confidential
around
the
clock
crisis
and
suicide
prevention
helpline
for
our
youth
so
i
want
to
thank
and
extend
my
gratitude
to
the
trevor
project
team
today
for
the
life
saving
work
they
do
to
help
LGBTQ
plus
youth
all
over
the
country
so

me

who
they
should
be

be

five
six
two
seven
two
eight
four
six
one

i
know
this
is
when
it
gets
like
this
again
there's
a
lot
of
kittens
were
looking
for
foster
homes
as
well
because
we
got
so
many
and
so
i
would
encourage
you
all
to
either
become
a
foster
parent
or
adopt
someone
like
it's
tallahassee
i
couldn't
see
it
in
my
glasses
and
yes
you're
looking
for
a
forever
home
i
know
thank
you
madam
chair
oh
where
she
love
OK
no
you
have
another
one
with
the
servers
are
cool
OK
over
the
side
too
far
away
from
the
dogs
and
cats
mister
kelly
front
and
center
thank
you
so
you
could
probably
argue
that
nobody
in
government
gets
much
respect
no
matter
where
they
work
but
arguably
the
person
who
gets
the
worst
rap
is
the
tax
guy
however
take
away
our
taxes
and
say
goodbye
to
the
roads
that
got
you
here
today
albiet
slowly
this
morning
goodbye
to
our
schools
goodbye
to
our
sewers
goodbye
to
the
beaches
goodbye
to
the
water
that
comes
out
of
the
plumbing
so
collecting
taxes
could
hardly
be
more
important
so
today
we
want
to
recognize
the
county
leader
who
has
been
collecting
our
taxes
for
the
last
five
years
and
has
spent
more
than
twenty
years
serving
LA
county
joe
kelly
big
applause
just
at
his
name
OK
what
are
the
flag
say
pay
now
what
do
they
say
joe
kelly
our
counties
treasurer
tax
collector
has
been
totally
indispensable
in
building
the
counties
relationships
with
the
people
who
do
our
banking
he
supervised
the
overhaul
of
the
department
's
website
so
although
it
might
be
painful
to
pay
your
taxes
it
wasn't
painful
any
longer
to
find
out
what
you
owed
on
how
to
pay
your
taxes
he's
been
a
very
strong
advocate
for
diversity
and
inclusion
and
worked
hard
to
secure
private
sector
financial
support
where
the
county
's
women
's
leadership
development
conference
and
the
hashtag
women
lead
la
effort
what
will
joe
do
in
retirement
without
millions
of
taxpayers
to
assist
he
claims
to
be
single
but
his
staff
knows
he's
a
busy
caretaker
raccoons
live
on
his
roof
a
family
of
skunks
or
hold
up
under
his
house
and
he
also
welcomes
wayward
relatives
including
a
city
mouse
in
a
coyote
rumor
has
a
debt
on
his
tax
form
he's
claimed
the
skunks
as
dependants
many
of
us
have
family
members
we
feel
the
same
way
about
joe
will
probably
spend
lots
of
time
eating
he's
an
equal
opportunistic
foodie
he
loves
good
food
preferably
organic
but
keep
an
eye
on
him
because
he's
got
a
thing
for
hershey
's
kisses
you
ever
see
a
guy
eating
shrimp
at
an
all
you
can
eat
buffet
that's
joe
with
hershey
's
kisses
then
there's
the
annual
GTC
holiday
card
joe
kicks
off
the
holiday
card
creation
process
around
halloween
take
a
look
at
a
few
examples
oh
great
talking
about
diversity
so
joe
you
been
a
fantastic
treasurer
and
tax
collector
and
i
would
be
remiss
at
here
at
the
end
of
june
if
i
didn't
also
say
i
was
very
very
proud
of
the
work
you've
done
as
a
member
of
our
LGBTQ
community
and
we're
proud
that
you
have
been
so
inclusive
in
so
many
ways
on
your
staff
and
in
terms
of
volunteers
and
other
people
who
worked
with
you
we
hope
that
your
ten
year
here
wasn't
taxing
and
that
you
treasure
your
retirement
OK
he
loves
puns
i
just
had
to
do
that
so
let
me
turn
the
mic
over
to
my
colleague
supervisor
barger
to
say
something
either
more
serious
or
funny
i
don't
know
but
all
of
its
true
about
joe
yeah
i
know
i
know
now
i'm
not
even
going
to
try
to
follow
that
up
joe
your
job
is
would
have
been
one
of
the
hardest
and
the
most
thankless
but
you've
handled
posyet
position
with
grace
am
with
precision
i
know
that
everyone
said
take
the
word
collector
off
because
you
never
want
to
be
associated
person
put
in
your
hand
out
to
get
the
money
but
truly
you
are
the
reason
why
this
county
is
operated
so
well
and
why
yesterday
we
were
able
to
adopt
a
budget
based
on
the
fact
that
you
had
fiscal
prudence
and
were
able
to
collect
on
all
the
taxes
owed
to
the
county
serving
as
a
treasurer
tax
collector
for
the
last
five
years
and
cheap
deputy
before
that
you
use
your
talent
and
fiscal
know
how
for
more
than
two
decades
we
know
you
always
been
business
we
have
constantly
counted
on
you
as
someone
to
go
by
the
book
and
do
the
right
thing
your
job
has
some
serious
responsibility
including
protecting
our
credit
rating
which
we
just
got
upgraded
thank
you
very
much
billing
collecting
dispersing
investing
borrowing
and
safeguarding
money
and
property
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
you
sit
on
our
retirement
board
which
arguably
is
probably
the
most
important
job
in
this
county
as
it
relates
to
the
largest
pension
program
in
the
country
were
proud
of
your
well
deserved
recognition
over
the
years
including
as
a
certified
internal
auditor
certified
treasury
professional
board
leadership
fellow
and
national
association
of
corporate
directors
and
as
a
member
as
i
said
at
the
lasara
board
of
retirement
and
board
of
investments
so
we
may
not
love
to
see
that
money
taken
out
of
your
checks
we
know
that
that
for
you
handling
it
with
care
and
responsibility
is
first
and
foremost
i
wish
you
a
happy
retirement
but
no
that
we're
always
here
the
door
is
always
open
and
you
will
not
be
forgotten
definitely
you've
left
this
county
in
a
far
better
place
and
i
think
we
would
all
agree
this
man
deserves
a
big
round
of
applause
and
before
you
speak
supervisor
ridley
thomas
would
like
to
say
something
thank
you
very
much
madam
chair
i
see
that
there
are
people
in
the
audience
standing
suggesting
that
the
legend
has
retired
i
want
to
join
my
colleagues
and
saying
a
word
about
joe
kelly
i
had
the
opportunity
to
see
him
run
the
department
's
business
continuity
program
exercise
and
we
have
not
seen
that
you
ought
to
us
a
quarterly
drill
that
involved
seamlessly
operating
the
department
some
mission
critical
functions
from
a
remote
backup
site
well
it
was
quite
remarkable
in
case
of
disaster
and
where
our
systems
get
thrown
in
other
things
that
we
choose
not
to
think
about
in
terms
of
attacks
this
operation
keeps
on
rolling
it
keeps
our
resources
in
tax
the
investments
that
we
make
are
not
at
risk
because
of
the
expert
work
joanne
his
team
i
also
had
the
opportunity
to
see
him
work
late
into
the
night
and
it
was
all
respectable
to
help
homeowners
that
was
supposed
to
be
funny
i'll
keep
my
day
job
late
into
the
evening
helping
those
homeowners
who
had
been
defrauded
and
i
have
to
tell
you
he
addressed
the
team
addressed
after
listening
to
their
complaints
and
the
implications
for
their
tax
bills
that
had
confused
them
and
put
them
at
risk
financially
further
exacerbating
the
marginal
status
that
many
of
them
already
found
themselves
then
it
did
without
causing
them
any
further
harm
so
seeing
joe
kelly
in
action
and
some
of
you
were
probably
a
part
of
that
effort
seeing
him
in
action
i
know
first
hand
how
it
took
his
role
or
seriously
mained
maintained
a
bit
of
self
deprecation
and
humor
and
kept
it
moving
and
for
that
joe
we
want
to
tell
you
that
we
appreciate
you
on
behalf
of
those
residents
who
needed
you
needed
the
county
and
you
stepped
up
big
round
of
applause
for
joe
kelly
as
he
retires
good
morning
i'm
thank
you
a
supervisor
kewl
and
burger
and
ridley
thomas
and
thank
you
and
thank
you
for
acknowledging
my
sense
of
humor
i
think
last
year
for
the
first
time
in
my
performance
evaluation
from
this
board
there
was
a
notation
joe
has
a
great
sense
of
humor
and
i
thought
why
it
took
me
four
years
to
get
here
i'm
really
happy
that
knowledge
this
only
because
we
have
a
sense
of
humor
as
well
joe
thank
you
for
putting
our
holiday
cards
up

been
an
important

a
round
of
applause
those
are
the
ones
you
should
have
claws
delighted
to
share
this
opportunity
with
the
chair
of
the
board
we
are
pleased
to
celebrate
the
second
year
of
the
newly
accredited
family
medison
and
psychiatry
residency
programs
the
residency
program
is
a
partnership
between
drew
and
the
county
including
the
departments
of
health
mental
health
and
public
health
along
a
unique
training
program
that
is
whole
person
centered
and
i
would
say
a
one
of
a
kind
experience
for
these
students
here
these
residents
that
cou
we
have
a
dramatic
shortage
of
primary
care
clinicians
in
this
nation
and
this
shortage
is
most
acute
in
communities
such
as
sparse
six
that
region
of
south
los
angeles
that
has
historically
been
an
area
that
could
and
should
attract
more
medical
investment
and
that's
what
this
university
along
with
them
OK
campus
is
all
about
the
family
medison
residents
in
the
drew
county
program
the
three
year
program
that
will
rotate
through
the
department
of
health
services
facilities
in
the
southern
region
of
our
county
including
MLK
outpatient
center
as
their
primary
training
site
by
year
three
there
will
be
a
steady
state
of
twenty
four
residents
in
the
family
medison
program
creating
a
pipeline
of
mission
driven
primary
care
clinicians
with
an
interest
in
working
with
those
who
are
medically
underserved
i
say
they
are
mission
driven
and
that's
where
the
psychiatry
program
i'm
particularly
enthusiastic
to
see
this
take
shape
as
some
of
you
know
we've
championed
here
on
this
board
mental
health
services
throughout
the
balance
of
the
time
i've
been
here
and
before
and
i
believe
it
is
critically
important
that
we
build
the
mental
health
workforce
it
is
an
investment
in
the
human
infrastructure
of
our
communities
simply
put
too
many
residents
of
our
county
particularly
an
underserved
areas
i'll
go
without
much
needed
mental
health
treatment
and
the
consequences
for
both
are
really
very
clear
and
dyer
the
primary
training
site
for
the
psychiatry
residents
is
kedren
community
health
center
and
the
residents
also
ruled
take
two
other
county
facilities
and
so
the
psychology
program
is
four
years
in
duration
and
accept
six
residents
in
each
class
and
at
it
steady
state
on
for
years
it
too
will
have
some
twenty
four
residents
and
training
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
both
of
these
programs
will
provide
an
exceptional
training
experience
with
these
residents
standing
here
in
front
of
you
due
to
the
excellent
leadership
at
cou
and
the
residency
training
program
team
the
historical
legacy
of
this
educational
or
academic
institution
under
the
leadership
of
doctor
carlisle
doctor
michael
doctor
protools
death
and
others
has
produced
graduates
who
continue
to
provide
much
needed
care
throughout
our
county
this
program
will
empower
these
doctors
in
training
to
become
medical
leaders
who
will
promote
wellness
well
being
and
health
care
equity
in
a
compassionate
manner
so
it's
my
sincere
hope
and
i
know
that
those
of
you
who
are
standing
here
with
maine
we'll
hear
this
message
to
loud
and
clear
it
is
that
the
completion
of
your
residency
many
of
you
will
opt
to
take
jobs
in
los
angelus
community
near
where
you
been
trained
i
want
you
to
get
that
near
where
you
have
been
trained
near
where
you
have
been
trained
and
finally
finally
i'll
be
remiss
if
i
didn't
acknowledge
the
hard
work
that
went
into
making
the
program
or
real
atillan
is
continued
success
due
to
the
leadership
of
our
county
health
agency
in
particular
fred
leave
christina
galley
jonathan
sharon

barber
for
her
get

these
emerging
leaders

to
the
incoming

know
when
i
first
heard
about
rancho
los
amigos
difficulty
with
recruiting
physicians
i
believe
that
establishing
a
residency
program
would
help
mitigate
the
issue
and
decrease
our
dependency
on
contractid
positions
and
as
a
result
supervisor
ridley
thomas
and
i
co
authored
emotion
to
establish
the
family
medison
ann
psychiatric
residency
program
in
partnership
with
charles
R
drew
university
school
of
madison
and
science
in
twenty
eighteen
and
recognize
our
first
incoming

exactly
a
year
ago
and
i
want
to
take
a
moment
to
recognize
the
successes
of
the
residency
program
at
rancho
los
amigos
in
just
the
first
year
of
residency
rancho
was
able
to
have
an
additional
two
thousand
seven
hundred
patient
provider
interactions
deliver
additional
services
for
persons
with
disabilities
within
the
adult
and
pediatric
programs
and
enhance
homeless
care
through
their
partnerships
with
MLK
the
first
year
residency
program
has
proven
to
be
a
success
and
i
have
faith
that
this
second
incoming
class
will
continue
to
add
to
these
accomplishments
were
eager
to
have
you
begin
your
residency
and
it

let's

of
charles

university

doctor
david

doctor

well
good
morning
and
greetings
to

why

couldn't
start
to
achieve
that
vision
if
we
weren't
training
doctors
in
the
areas
where
they're
needed
most
because
it's
true
that
if
you
want
to
doctor
to
work
somewhere
the
best
way
to
get
them
to
work
there
is
to
train
them

not

training
physicians

thousand

it's
about

there
any
indication
that

anything

red

financial

we
look
to
the

to
restore
some
faith
in

the
treasurer

collector

i
work
twelve
years
with
the
registrar

i
i
am
here
today
to
express
my
concern
on
what's
taking
place
with
lasara
i
am
referring
of
course
to
the
sudden
dismissal
miss
less
it
and
i'm
not
alone
in
my
concern
in
the
past
couple
of
weeks
i
have
received
dozens
of
phones
of
calls
from
members
and
retirees
and
they
all
asked
the
same
question
why
was
the
lasara
CEO
fired
after
less
than
seven
months
on
the
job
is
lucero
playing
politics
or
are
with
our
retirement
does
turnover
an
instability
put
our
retirement
at
risk
will
the
next
CEO
be
chosen
based
on
qualifications
or
political
affiliations
we
don't
know
the
answers
to
these
questions
and
they
are
very
important
questions
that
we
need
to
know
no
explanations
was
provided
regarding
misle
's
lessons
dismissal
not
even
one
of
a
general
nature
list
era
is
not
a
private
equity
fund
regularly
thank
you
very
much
next
speaker
please
thank
you
madam
chair
in
a
steam
board
members
my
name
is
david
dunbar
and
i
represent
the
department
of
public
social
services
i'm
also
a
member
of
lasara
and
a
proud
member
leader
of
the
mighty
sei
U
seven
two
one
i
share
the
feelings
already
expressed
by
my
fellow
union
members
the
lasara
seals
dismissal
barely
six
months
into
her
job
was
sudden
and
strange
it
was
done
without
explanation
or
justification
ann
it
was
done
in
the
way
that
shakes
are
faithless
era
public
dollars
keep
lasara
going
the
financial
in
personnel
decisions
made
by
the
lasserre
board
of
investments
and
board
of
retirement
affect
the
well
being
of
tens
of
thousands
of
employees
their
decisions
affect
the
well
being
of
our
family
members
are
dependent
and
our
love
ones
some
of
them
are
elected
by
us
the
employees
and
retirees
and
los
angeles
county
others
are
appointed
by
you
the
members
of
the
los
angeles
county
board
of
supervisors
yet
the
sun
dismissal
of
the
CEO
with
zero
explanation
seems
to
indicate
that
they
don't
feel
they
are
accountable
to
anyone
and
this
needs
to
change
we
understand
that
this
was
a
personnel
decision
nevertheless
we
deserve
at
least
a
general
explanation
of
why
the
boards
felt
compelled
to
suddenly
terminate
her
employment
lasara
is
our
retirement
fund
but
recent
events
have
shown
that
is
not
being
treated
as
being
treated
more
like
a
private
equity
fund
and
this
cannot
continue
thank
you
next
speaker
please
OK
we're
going
to
ask
the
audience
one
of
the
rules
of
decorum
that
we
try
to
keep
here
is
to
not
applaud
or
boo
from
the
audience
so
if
you
agree
with
someone
you
can
raise
the
roof
and
if
you
disagree
with
them
you
can
put
your
thumbs
down
but
it
keeps
the
meeting
going
smoother
if
we
don't
applaud
every
time
someone
speaks
thank
you
very
much
next
speaker
please
give
monetary
value
guys
doing
this
morning
my
name
is
all
or
indonesia
i'm
retired
deputy
sheriff
started
orange
county
LA
county
that
are
over
the
LA
county
move
to
florida
start
in
florida
walmart
florida
we
started
a
nonprofit
organization
dealing
with
the
veterans
with
the
homeless
situation
going
on
out
there
we
kind
of
nipped
in
the
bud
with
the
homeless
situation
out
there
with
the
veterans
out
there
put
in
many
many
many
veterans
to
work
to
school
and
we
pretty
much
got
that
handled
out
here
i
notice
that
when
i
tried
to
contact
anyone
deal
about
the
homeless
situation
is
kind
of
difficult
i
had
this
plan
to
start
me
and
my
partners
in
the
business
that
wanted
to
start
a
village
that
will
be
set
outside
the
county
which
we
know
you
have
places
like
in
santa
monica
areas
where
reciva
dism
who's
big
and
beds
of
like
one
hundred
to
two
hundred
fifty
we
had
a
proposal
sent
in
we
had
never
heard
anything
back
from
anyone
with
our
facility
for
one
thousand
to
eighteen
hundred
beds
made
out
of
shipping
containers
which
we
can
get
out
of
very
discount
price
within
that
facility
they
will
have
everything
needed
in
a
compound
nursing
a
medical
or
food
classes
are
certificate
programs
the
things
different
from
all
program
is
that

fifteen
thousand
dollar
job

thank

next
speaker
place
madam
chair
members
of
the
board
on
mars
griffin
better
known
as
big
money
griff
the
problem
solver
and
I
rise
today
on
behalf
of
my
sei
U
LA
county
retirees
but
more
importantly
i'm
here
to
add
fuel
to
the
fire
when
we
look
at
what
lasara
has
been
doing
there
been
taking
advantage
of
us
i
don't
know
if
it's
a
transitional
problem
but
we
need
you
to
make
sure
that
you
say
not
on
my
watch
becaus
i
have
here
where
lucero
wants
to
give
me
twenty
four
years
of
service
and
i
have
here
a
certificate
that
shows
that
mister
griffin
has
thirty
years
of
service
there's
a
problem
here
but
less
error
refuses
to
recognize
that
fact
so
i'm
here
today
to
say
to
you
all
that
is
time
for
us
to
take
a
look
at
less
arabic
cause
they're
trying
to
take
advantage
of
us
especially
our
retirees
and
so
i'm
here
today
to
say
to
those
of
you
not
only
here
in
the
audience
that
we've
got
to
take
a
strong
look
at
what
they're
doing
becaus
this
is
a
problem
and
it
deals
with
our
percentage
when
we
retire
you
got
twenty
four
years
of
service
at
your
age
and
that
percentage
makes
a
difference
makes
makes
a
big
difference
in
our
livelihoods
or
whether
or
not
we're
going
to
be
one
paycheck
away
from
being
homeless
which
brings
me
to
this
question
thank
you
if
you
need
to
turn
in
that
question
will
read
it
next
speaker
please
thank
you
i
am
darrell
crews
good
morning
if
rick
valaska
's
was
honest
with
you

days
they'd
be
assuring
license
for
marijuana
dispensers
it's
been
over
five
thousand
one
hundred
and
thirty
days
and
you
have
not
issued
a
marijuana
cannabis
business
license
to
anyone
yet
you
allow
seventy
of
them
to
operate
and
do
nothing
about
it
if
he
was
honest
with
you
rick
richard
do
valasquez
was
honest
with
you
he
would
tell
you
that
we
had
an
agreement
he
shook
my
hand
we
he
asked
me
to
work
with
him
and
i
agreed
to
work
with
him
he
agreed
to
work
with
maine
i
did
everything
that
was
asked
they
never
help
me
out
and
he
went
don
kanobby
said
there
was
no
deal
he
wasn't
a
man
he
was
a
coward
rick
alaska
should
have
stood
up
and
said
yeah
i
shook
his
hand
we
had
a
deal
the
deal
included
the
fact
that
they
would
not
use
excessive
zoning
techniques
and
then
they
used
excessive
zoning
techniques
including
limitations
against
being
within
a
thousand
feet
of
the
god
damn
churches
thank
you
mister
really
thomas
did
you
have
did
you
push
your
button
to
speak
well
i'm
sure
i
did
want
to
say
a
word
about
the
the
appropriate
time
about
the
issue
that's
been
called
to
attention
on
the
sarah
matter
you
tell
me
when
it's
appropriate
to
do
so
and
i'll
do
so
and
maybe
after
the
other
speakers
or
whatever
your
pleasure
maybe
after
the
public
comment
and
then
we
have
after
this
we
have
an
items
not
held
held
by
the
board
so
maybe
after
yes
i'll
ask
my
county
council
wanted
to
appropriate
next
speaker
plays
under
a
board
of
supervisors
my
name
is
laree
leaving
them
from
encino
euphemisms
mental
health
court
could
more
honestly
be
called
the
court
of
the
psychiatrist
mental
health
does
not
cover
the
broad
range
of
problems
that
one
would
expect
to
find
under
that
title
mental
health
court
does
not
cover
autistic
or
down
syndrome
patients
or
any
other
patients
outside
the
psychiatric
world
i
ask
this
board
that
from
now
on
whenever
possible
for
the
sake
of
being
honest
when
conducting
county
business
to
replace
the
words
mental
health
with
psychiatric
health
and
instead
of
referring
to
the
medison
S
psychotropic
medison
called
the
medison
what
it
is
psychiatric
madison
this
way
everyone
knows
what
we
are
talking
about
when
we
say
mental
health
psychiatry
and
psychiatric
madison
is
not
right
for
psychiatrists
to
put
up
a
front
and
hide
behind
euphemisms
let's
not
fool
the
people
thank
you
thank
you
next
speaker
please
good
morning
supervisors
county
council
and
CEO
couple
of
observations
about
yesterday's
process
in
dealing
with
the
jail
and
mental
health
issues
maybe
it's
the
topic
of
jalen
the
emotion
lated
imagery
that
goes
along
with
it
about
victimization
harmon
safety
or
maybe
the
institutional
momentum
that
mister
lysberg
noted
but
we
seem
to
have
had
a
kind
of
under
proportionate
full
explanation
disclosure
and
discussion
on
the
contract
ing
process
itself
what's
involved
in
it
getting
in
it
getting
out
of
it
anyway
as
i
understand
it
even
wanted
you
said
whether
you
said
this
is
the
first
time
that
there's
been
such
confusion
that
was
chair
han
so
i
think
we
need
we
need
more
well
we
need
more
care
and
let's
have
a
few
times
as
possible
for
that
a
few
words
about
the
term
breach
of
contract
that
came
up
of
course
that
can
be
a
serious
matter
i'd
like
to
use
the
word
in
another
way
let's
be
careful
there's
possible
also
to
breach
the
implied
contract
that
you
folks
undertook
appan
going
into
office
the
contract
to
use
the
most
advanced
and
evolving
standards
of
evidence
basis
and
best
practices
in
public
safety
for
the
well
being
of
the
community
including
by
the
way
the
well
being
and
the
safety
of
officers
that's
part
of
this
whole
package
it
all
goes
together
that's
the
breach
i'd
like
to
be
more
attentive
to
thank
you
next
finger
please
hi
my
name
is
ezekiel
ray
's
because
i
have
personally
talked
to
hundreds
of
la
homeless
over
the
years
while
maintaining
communication
with
some
of
them
i
have
found
that
there
is
a
need
for
particular
questions
to
be
added
to
every
homeless
entry
questionnaire
packet
thus
far
being
used
i
employed
at
the
board
ad
for
new
questions
to
losses
entry
questionnaire
packet
first
question
being
how
often
does
said
person
eat
second
question
where
is
most
of
the
persons
food
acquired
third
question
how
i
said
food
acquired
in
fourth
question
how
far
does
one
have
to
go
to
acquire
said
food
having
these
questions
answered
by
those
that
are
homeless
could
allow
the
steps
needed
when
trying
to
differentiate
between
individuals
whom
have
a
higher
probability
of
a
developing
a
mental
illness
and
or
drug
addiction
faster
said
levels
of
starvation
felton
rhythmic
patterns
speed
up
the
RAC
H
T
process
again
this
process
needs
to
be
slowed
down
as
much
as
possible
so
that
the
minds
of
set
individuals
dealing
with
said
transition
do
so
without
being
completely
damaged
a
program
of
department
of
D
P
S
S
specifically
devised
for
those
that
are
homeless
will
need
to
be
started
generalife
is
not
meant
for
those
sleeping
outside
on
the
streets
given
that
most
if
not
all
outside
homeless
using
GR
have
already
run
out
of
funds
needed
for
the
most
basic
necessities
still
being
overlooked
at
this
point
in
time
and
that
being
food
thank
you
thank
you
we
need
to
call
some
more
names
up
would
herman
herman
patricia
mcallister
king
lawyer
wayne
spinnler
antonio
ramirez
damien
washington
dark
david
larson
and
yolanda
tompkins
please
come
forward
and
staff
will
assist
you
OK
max
speaker
please
thank
you
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
yesterday
there
was
a
big
brouhaha
about
whether
or
not
the
mccarthy
group
to
contract
ing
company
should
be
given
thirty
million
dollars
or
more
or
less
to
get
rolling
on
a
project
that
is
not
fully
been
brought
into
focus
because
of
this
great
boards
view
that
maybe
we
should
do
less
incarcerating
and
more
mental
health
but
there's
a
misunderstanding
and
with
all
respect
to
the
chinatown
group
unity
we
can't
you
know
we're
not
going
to
be
affective
by
having
one
centralized
chamber
of
mental
health
or
jail
we
have
to
find
a
way
to
provide
the
services
in
a
satellite
like
set
up
where
you
know
like
you
don't
have
one
gas
station
in
town
you
have
multiple
gas
stations
and
we
need
to
have
something
closer
to
that
to
conquer
this
problem
because
in
every
community
there
are
people
and
when
you
hear
from
people
in
the
supervisor
hans
district
down
in
san
pedro
who
have
to
spend
all
their
time
dragging
people
up
to
the
here
and
back
and
forth
it's
not
it's
not
cool
or
affective
so
i
would
ask
that
we
look
at
that
contract
with
mccarthy
and
really
try
to
figure
out
what's
going
on
there
and
get
a
better
deal
get
a
deal
that
makes
sense
for
the
people
now
in
terms
of
lasara
i
just
'cause
i
know
that
people
are
here
and
concern
i
think
what's
important
here
is
transparency
first
of
all
and
second
well
i
can't
understand
why
they
would
not
be
a
part
of
a
national
search
if
there's
going
to
be
a
replacement
that
just
makes
no
sense
at
all
to
me
because
this
is
a
group
that
is
direct
beneficiaries
of
this
kind
of
leadership
and
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
feeling
that
people
know
exactly
what's
going
on
with
the
next
speaker
place
my
name
is
lynne
plambeck
i'm
here
from
santa
clarita
organization
for
planning
and
the
environment
today
is
the
two
year
anniversary
of
your
boards
approval
of
the
chiquita
canyon
landfill
expansion
for
thirty
years
doubling
it
in
size
next
to
the
low
income
disadvantage
community
of
val
verde
and
in
the
santa
clarita
valley
where
we
already
have
durable
air
pollution
the
ER
was
certified
based
on
air
monitors
that
are
not
even
in
the
santa
clarita
valley
and
fugitive
methane
releases
are
were
contradicted
by
the
air
quality
management
board
since
that
time
the

the
LA
sheriff's
department

the
rest
of
my
life
that

the

department
and
the
LA
sheriff's
department
who
has
no
jurisdiction
will
tell
me
you
are
barred
from
everything
now
just
so
you
know
so
security
you
know
i
was
right
by
the
deputy
director
of
the
health
department
because
it's
in
your
records
and
because
you
know
i
work
for
simpson
and
simpson
and
then
i
was
fired
without
cause
from
the
county
you
know
that
is
a
fact
i'm
being
asked
to
leave
by
everyone
on
this
council
no
one
here
cares
that
i
was
raped
by
the
deputy
director
of
the
health
department
what
do
you
do
when
your
health
care
provider
says
no
one
cares
you
were
raped
and
if
you
think
you're
going
to
find
someone
who
cares
you're
raped
you
are
wrong
you
are
either
going
to
end
up
in
jail
this
is
la
sheriff's
department
you
will
end
up
in
jail
you
will
end
up
in
a
mental
institution
or
you
will
kill
yourself
before
you
will
get
an
answer
from
the
county
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
OK
for
a
doctor
A
nurse
a
therapist
to
engage
in
sex
with
you
when
you're
severely
medicated
and
severely
injured
the
answer
so
far
is
been
any
employee

wants
can
do
that
and
if
you
want
the
right
to
not
have
them
have

notice
that
blobs
of
african
americans
and
then
latino
start
coming
in
when
i
put
my
shopping
cart
outside
starbucks
and
what
he
does
is
he
texts
all
the
homies
and
let
them
know
that
i'm
coming
in
and
then
that
gives
them
time
while

that
you
just
heard
some
of
the
people
who
were
vendor
number
three
five
seven
nine
four
seven
nine
that
were
actually
LA
county
vendors
at
work
for
parks
after
dark
that
didn't
get
paid
still
you
have
people
like
elva
espinoza
who
is
your
sister
hilda
solis
elva
espinoza
who
had
one
job
and
to
process
the
payments
and
she
didn't
even
feel
it
was
necessary
to
do
that
were
tired
of
latina
white
and
asian
cultures
telling
us
what
to
do
disrespecting
us
because
we're
black
before
you
put
that
dumb
ass
shit
on
the
agenda
you
need
to
help
figure
out
why
we
didn't
get
paid
from
parks
after
dark
OK
the
anymore
members
of
the
public
to
speak
at
this
time
OK
because
of
the
time
we
will
now
go
to
oh
i
will
now
go
to
mark
ridley
thomas
thank
you
but
i'm
here
on
the
matter
that
came
to
our
attention
by
members
of
sei
U
current
employees
and
retirees
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
we
need
to
at
least
be
attentive
to
some
of
those
concerns
we
read
about
some
other
than
the
newspaper
yesterday
i
think
it
should
be
established
that
the
scope
of
our
authority
has
yet
to
be
fully
vetted
but
madam
chair
and
colleagues
i
wonder
if
it
wouldn't
be
appropriate
of
four
county
council
CEO
and
auditor
controller
to
give
us
a
current
document
as
to
what
their
assessment
of
circumstances
are
the
extent
to
which
the
board
since
we
do
have
appointees
in
the
like
cannons
should
be
apprised
of
anything
that
would
be
appropriate
for
us
to
do
i
do
not
think
we
can
afford
to
be
unaware
of
anything
that
could
ultimately
impact
of
the
county
but
at
the
same
time
we
need
to
be
mindful
of
the
scope
and
or
the
limits
of
our
responsibilities
i
do
believe
as
the
governing
body
of
the
board
of
supervisors
we
ought
to
proactively
be
concerned
about
what
is
going
on
ticular
one
employees
and
these
numbers
and
or
retirees
have
called
it
to
our
attention
so
i
would
just
ask
that
that
be
explored
if
it
needs
to
be
properly
agendized
or
whatever
the
case
may
be
madam
county
council
to
give
us
the
instructions
and
we
can
go
from
there
thank
you
madam
chair
thank
you
ann
i
know
some
of
my
colleagues
want
to
speak
i
also
supervisor
so
lease
and
i
are
dropping
emotion
to
be
agendized
july
night
they're
not
know
there
might
be
based
on
what
you
just
said
some
other
tax
that
we
want
to
take
but
this
one
is
moving
that
the
board
of
supervisors
sent
a
five
signature
letter
to
the
los
angeles
county
employees
retirement
association
lissara
boards
of
retirement
investments
respectively
calling
on
them
to
conduct
a
fair
an
open
leadership
transition
process
and
to
create
a
search
committee
that
represents
the
serres
diverse
stakeholders
including
at
least
one
member
who
was
elected
by
the
serres
general
membership
and
that
will
be
agendized
july
ninth
but
again
we
might
have
some
other
actions
that
we'd
like
to
take
supervisor
barger
thank
you
and
actually
really
thomas
that's
what
i
was
going
to
ask
and
i
have
to
ask
county
council
it
sounds
like
this
process
is
moving
pretty
quickly
and
so
i
know
this
motions
for
july
ninth
but
i
wonder
if
the
whole
thought
of
national
search
if
in
fact
that's
true
that's
true
or
not
true
there's
been
no
transparency
on
this
i
am
concerned
and
i
think
that
i
don't
know
if
we
can
put
it
on
as
an
urgency
for
closed
session
given
the
fact
that
we
just
found
out
about
that
part
i
mean
i
know
you've
got
your
motion
but
i
think
what
i'm
hearing
from
this
area
is
that
this
is
moving
in
real
real
fast
time
and
i
just
M
concerned
about
how
this
is
all
playing
out
and
i
don't
know
what
are
authority
is
meteor
points
that's
why
i
think
that's
just
threw
mine
everybody
we're
not
having
a
board
meeting
next
week
so
that's
why
this
was
a
generalized
but
maybe
this
would
be
appropriate
to
be
voted
on
today
at
least
again
this
one
tact
again
there
might
be
others
to
address
this
urgency
finding
today
come
to
the
attention
of
the
board
since
the
posting
of
the
agenda
based
in
the
public
testimony
today
and
needs
to
be
addressed
today
can't
wait
if
you
make
that
fine
being
it's
a
four
vote
finding
then
it's
an
urgency
matter
that
we
could
discuss
in
close
session
today
i
mean
i
think
i
think
that
we
should
discuss
it
in
closed
session
i
don't
know
what's
fact
and
what's
fiction
but
obviously
what
i'm
hearing
is
is
that
there's
a
lot
happening
very
quickly
and
and
i
just
have
some
concerns
about
that
and
some
old
pursuant
to
county
councils
instruction
supervisor
so
yeah
i
agree
i
think
this
is
an
urgency
matter
so
i
would
i
would
agree
that
we
should
move
forward
on
this
and
if
there's
anything
else
that
should
be
added
i'm
i'm
sure
we
can
discuss
that
but
i
would
move
i
would
second
that
motion
right
do
we
take
that
vote
now
OK
so
it's
been
moved
and
seconded
that
we
have
since
the
posting
of
the
yes
surprise
are
cute
so
just
to
clarify
since
what
is
all
this
is
sort
of
just
dropped
on
our
desk
here
the
dishes
a
aredian
motion
to
be
acted
on
in
open
session
correct
to
send
a
five
signature
letter
to
both
lashara
borge
calling
on
them
to
conduct
a
fair
and
open
leadership
transition
process
and
to
create
a
search
committee
that
represents
diverse
stakeholders
including
at
least
one
member
elected
by
the
general
membership
is
that
correct
and
this
would
be
because
i
think
we
actually
have
had
some
information
over
the
past
year
about
our
authority
i'm
sorry
and
we
we
need
to
have
quiet
in
the
auditorium
i
think
we
had
some
indication
over
the
year
about
the
limitation
of
our
authority
to
dictate
to
those
boards
so
this
is
ascentia
leah
five
signature
letter
requesting
their
consideration
of
what
we
think
would
be
the
right
thing
to
do
correct
is
there
anyway
to
ascertain
whether
the
members
who
were
elected
by
the
general
membership
participated
in
the
vote
i
realize
it's
closed
session
but
i
think
it
would
be
good
for
us
to
understand
because
you
know
you
can
come
to
public
comment
and
you
can
say
do
something
about
it
but
i
kind
of
wanted
to
know
if
there
participated
because
there
has
been
some
conflicting
information
the
only
information
we
get
from
our
own
appointees
and
of
course
they
don't
tell
me
what
happens
in
close
session
as
they
shouldn't
but
sort
of
different
and
are
you
talking
about
the
vote
too
fire
yes
yeah
'cause
there's
kind
of
two
different
issues
there's
that
and
then
there's
moving
forward
on
to
search
on
the
search
my
other
thing
is
i
think
a
national
church
doesn't
happen
in
a
week
or
two
or
three
i
mean
no
matter
who
does
it
and
how
they
do
it
there's
kind
of
a
long
timeline
i
mean
i
feel
support
this
today
but
i
have
to
say
i
kind
of
balk
at
the
idea
a
little
bit
of
telling
in
independent
entity
who
should
be
on
their
search
committee
but
what
we're
saying
is
we
care
i'm
sorry
my
turn
were
saying
today
i
care
but
i
think
we're
needing
to
know
and
recognize
that
we
can't
dictate
i
don't
think
that
yeah
i
think
you're
right
we
can
get
further
guidance
from
council
in
terms
of
the
specifics
of
what's
in
front
of
us
in
terms
of
the
urgency
matter
and
the
extent
to
which
that
then
goes
into
closed
session
pursuant
to
the
four
bold
item
sure
so
a
few
things
number
one
the
interim
CEO
for
lasara
is
in
the
audience
mister
steven
rice
so
i
don't
know
if
he's
at
liberty
to
discuss
anything
publicly
but
i
just
want
to
bring
that
to
the
board
's
attention
if
you'd
like
to
hear
from
him
that's
number
one
number
two
i'm
viewing
the
july
ninth
motion
as
just
playing
out
on
july
ninth
and
viewing
today
as
an
opportunity
if
the
board
finds
a
need
to
on
an
urgency
finding
to
discuss
generally
the
relationship
between
this
board
and
lasara
in
closed
session
so
the
urgency
finding
on
viewing
would
be
so
that
that
discussion
could
take
place
in
closed
session
today
and
that
is
essentially
what
i'm
owed
for
the
boards
consideration
so
what
about
this
motion
to
act
on
this
today
i
don't
see
this
as
necessary
going
into
close
session
that's
just
be
agendized
for
the
ninth
and
voted
on
in
the
regular
course
on
the
night
no
i
know
it
wouldn't
act
of
mergent
findings
also
relate
to
emotion
like
this
again
after
posting
of
the
agenda
madam
chair
yeah
i
think
we
should
go
into
close
session
because
of
information
is
come
to
us
and
then
we
can
take
up
and
if
we
decide
to
move
on
this
motion
based
on
county
council
's
recommendation
at
the
information
that
came
to
us
we
can
come
back
into
open
session
and
do
that
'cause
i'm
not
hearing
from
county
council
right
now
that
this
would
rise
to
the
level
of
emergency
motion
is
that
what
you're
trying
to
say
well
if
we
if
we
find
it
i
don't
know
i'm
trying
i'm
trying
to
get
clarification
of
course
is
what
you've
just
recommended
supervisor
we
could
have
the
conversation
first
and
then
the
board
can
decide
but
the
urgency
finding
must
be
made
to
have
that
conversation
correct
right
OK
yeah
i'm
sure
i
was
so
move
on
the
urgency
to
take
the
item
into
closed
session
the
item
in
terms
of
what
has
come
to
our
attention
which
is
not
that
which
is
posted
for
giuly
night
that
is
the
range
of
other
issues
that
we
need
to
consider
and
i
would
again
so
move
OK
moved
and
seconded
that
we
will
now
we
need
to
take
a
vote
right
so
that
we
need
a
roll
call
supervisor
solice
i
supervises
silly
size
supervisor
ridley
thomas
supervisor
really
thomas
eyes
supervisor
kewl
super
rezac
your
eyes
supervisor
barger
supervisor
burger
eyes
supervisor
hunt
supervisor
hanai
motion
carries
ford
a
fight
is
zero
so
that's
only
that
we
take
it
in
the
closest
around
without
it
being
agenda
is
today
that's
all
we
did
don't
get
too
excited
OK
um
we
will
now
move
to
the
set
item
the
report
on
the
elimination
of
the
use
of
OC
spray
and
and
please
if
you're
going
to
exit
and
we
ask
that
you
do
it
as
quietly
as
possible

still
happening

a
superhuman
calling
you
first
to
make
opening

thank

department
is
partners
and
all
those
who
worked
with
it
to
answer

motions
concerning
pepper
spray
and
really
the
larger
question
of
the
treatment
of
our
young
people
in
our
probation
facilities
i
would
reserve
comment
for
after
all
the
presentations
but
just
to
thank
people
for
getting
us
the
report
bringing
it
to
us
and
taking
this
of
course
very
seriously
thank
you
thank
you
OK
will
first
hear
from
terry
mcdonald
chief
probation
officer
thank
you
madam
chair
members
of
the
board
thank
you
for
the
opportunity
today
to
report
back
on
your
motion
to
eliminate
OC
spray
i
want
to
thank
the
many
people
that
have
engaged
with
the
department
whether
that's
through
their
probation
reform
implementation
team
or
the
public
defender
who
provided
feedback
our
employees
are
seabios
and
our
partners
in
mental
health
and
let
go
who
helped
guide
this
proposal
i
will
say
that
this
is
important
we
should
do
it
it's
going
to
be
it's
going
to
be
a
challenge
for
us
to
do
it
but
we
will
succeed
i
believe
that
i
believe
working
together
with
the
department
of
mental
health
training
our
own
employees
and
investing
in
them
increasing
programming
opportunity
and
relying
on
diversion
another
community
based
services
to
reduce
our
overall
population
in
the
halls
is
the
right
approach
what's
been
proposed
as
a
paradigm
shift
from
detention
and
control
into
treatment
and
trauma
informed
setting
we
all
know
that
our
juvenile
halls
or
with
the
young
people
reach
us
in
the
most
crises
they've
been
detained
they're
going
back
and
forth
to
court
they
may
be
on
medications
that
are
prescribed
they
may
be
off
their
medications
and
their
constantly
churning
through
the
halls
we
also
know
that
it's
the
entry
portal
for
our
employees
so
we
have
the
experience
where
our
youth
in
the
most
crises
are
being
supervised
managed
and
overseen
are
least
experienced
employees
for
the
most
part
this
program
relies
on
an
investment
in
more
programming
for
mental
health
more
programming
bye
seabios
more
training
for
our
employees
more
services
for
youth
but
it
also
asks
foreign
investment
and
staff
because
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
we're
not
going
to
be
able
to
provide
the
kind
of
services
and
support
to
do
the
kind
of
program
and
we
need
to
do
the
profound
shift
with
our
existing
staffing
compliment
i
know
it's
not
easy
i
know
it's
a
big
ask
and
i
understand
that
we
gave
some
numbers
that
i
think
still
need
to
be
further
refined
with
the
chief
executive
officer
but
i
will
say
something
is
simply
is
adding
additional
staff
member
on
days
inn
PM
seven
days
a
week
to
each
housing
unit
is
in
of
itself
one
hundred
fifty
employees
currently
today
we
have
anywhere
from
sixty
to
one
hundred
staff
off
post
supervising
kids
on
individual
supervision
that's
destabilizing
our
staffing
package
in
its
destabilizing
the
units
because
the
staff
are
working
overtime
in
those
units
to
backfill
so
there
are
some
shifts
we
need
to
make
we
proposed
a
rather
robust
ratio
we
know
that
the
county
doesn't
have
unlimited
dollars
and
we
know
that
that
may
adjust
but
we've
also
done
much
to
address
the
costs
of
probation
we've
closed
seven
camps
or
will
have
closed
seven
camps
by
the
end
of
next
month
since
our
arrival
in
january
twenty
seventeen
for
the
first
time
ever
we
are
closing
the
juvenile
hall
we
have
we
have
worked
to
send
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
to
diversion
efforts
office
diversion
and
re
entry
we're
going
to
use
juvenile
justice
funds
to
enhance
programs
in
the
halls
and
camps
so
i
know
it's
going
to
be
a
difficult
lift
and
it
difficult
ask
i
know
it
will
come
with
criticism
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
if
we
want
to
profoundly
change
the
juvenile
holes
from
control
and
confinement
to
rehabilitation
to
engagement
to
flourishing
youth
and
then
we're
going
to
have
to

this
initiative
and
the
public
defender

has
some
creative
ideas
about
how
they
can
be
helpful

this
transformation

fully

without
further

the
importance

mental

and
working
course
solving
this
problem
i'm
here
to
introduce
two
of
my
esteemed
colleagues
from
my
team
first
doctor
christopher
thompson
who
is
a

we
all
know
we
were
lucky

get
to
come
help
lead
or
juvenile
operations
and
deputy
rector
delilah
alcantara
who
will
help
do
the
overview
in
partnership
yes
i
meant
in
them
in
my
opening
remarks
hey
good
good
morning
honorable
board
so
it's
really
thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
present
or
a
plan
to
phase
out
OC
spray
over
the
last
many
months
we've
had
the
good
pleasure
of
spending
countless
hours
days
weekends
with
our
mental
health
partners
to
create
this
plan
and
others
as
a
chief
described
since
our
arrival
we've
closed
six
camps
the
seventh
one
will
be
closed
next
month
closing
all
of
challenger
in
juvenile
whole
i
think
what
this
presents
is
an
opportunity
for
us
to
have
a
smaller
footprint
and
then
to
really
focus
on
on
creating
centers
of
excellence
for
eight
hundred
plus
young
people
that
are
in
detention
in
any
given
day
our
plan
is
grounded
in
the
framework
of
creating
therapeutic
environments
where
kids
young
people
can
prosper
and
have
and
staff
have
the
tools
to
really
do
a
great
job
and
so
we
have
a
couple
of
slides
that
we
wanted
to
share
with
you
when
we
looked
at
developing
the
plan
you
know
we
wanted
to
make
sure
that
we
left
no
stone
unturned
we
did
a
series
of
benchmarking
throughout
the
country
some
of
our
staff
for
DMH
partners
and
and
others
we
had
the
opportunity
to
go
to
santa
clara
county
who
does
not
use
soap
spray
louisiana
who
actually
phase
that
OC
spray
we
spoke
with
oklahoma
who
phase
that
OC
spray
i'm
in
san
diego
we
visited
them
as
well
because
they
have
a
unique
response
to
dealing
with
young
people
that
have
extremely
traumatic
experiences
we
have
scheduled
a
visit
site
visit
to
sacramento
and
then
one
to
new
york
as
well
new
york
through
like
is
allen
one
of
the
unique
things
that
they
did
was
when
they
changed
the
minimum
age
then
they
moved
young
people
offer
rikers
allen
that
was
formally
a
supervised
by
the
department
of
corrections
to
the
youth
services
division
they
also
eliminate
it
using
OC
spray
so
i
think
what
we've
done
is
to
include
what
we've
learned
in
our
site
visits
include
the
information
that
we
got
from
the
many
hearings
done
by
the
probation
reform
implementation
team
including
the
special
hearing
and
then
also
in
terms
of
the
office
of
the
inspector
general
so
all
of
those
recommendations
or
waited
in
embedded
in
our
plan
to
phase
out
OC
spray
as
you
can
see
most
jurisdictions
have
done
this
in
one
and
a
half
to
two
years
our
plan
is
very
ambitious
as
delilah
will
speak
more
about
it
is
that
we
propose
to
phase
out
OC
spray
within
a
years
period
of
time
and
so
and
then
we've
done
it
in
a
phased
approach
that
we
will
describe
so
we
have
some
keys
strategies
that
are
all
interrelated
one
is
is
that
with
the
closure
of
an
azuka
which
is
our
last
camp
that's
operating
a
challenger
we
will
no
longer
have
OC
spray
in
any
one
of
our
camps
are
phaseout
includes
eliminate
it
in
its
entire
T
june
the
thirtieth
twenty
twenty
but
one
thing
that
we
really
embraces
that
the
county
committed
too
many
years
ago
that
implementing
the
LA
model
at
campus
kilpatrick
so
he
spent
the
last
couple
of
months
and
looking
at
how
does
one
implement
the
tenants
of
a
culture
of
care
in
a
juvenile
whole
so
we're
using
that
approach
which
has
multidisciplinary
teams
that
are
comprised
of
our
damage
partners
or
educators
or
community
based
organizations
all
using
a
positive
youth
development
framework
a
big
part
of
our
plan
is
about
staff
developments
after
tree
staff
training
and
when
we
share
this
with
you
at
some
of
our
non
traditional
training
some
training
we've
never
done
with
our
institutional
staff
before
and
then
it's
also
the
enhanced
collaboration
with
DMH
in
a
communication
efforts
with
them
and
so
this
is
a
pretty
long
but
it's
like
different
actions
here
but
it
was
planning
for
the
elimination
of
OC
spray
so
some
of
it
in
order
to
create
therapeutic
environments
means
that
we
have
to
do
something
regarding
a
physical
plant
that's
contained
partially
in
our
budget
it's
similar
to
what
we
have
done
at
campus
kilpatrick
but
it's
more
what
we've
done
like
at
central
juvenile
hall
recently
with
our
boys
care
unit
and
now
with
our
girls
care
unit
underway
but
looking
at
the
physical
environment
increasing
programmatic
things
because
what
we
know
when
young
folks
have
meaningful
program
and
are
not
idle
that
opportunities
for
them
to
engage
in
anything
other
than
what
we
want
them
to
gauge
in
is
it
becomes
kind
of
neil
and
so
improved
increased
programming
we've
already
reached
out
and
have
commitments
from
various
stakeholders
to
do
bring
incredible
messengers
within
our
juvenile
holes
to
help
in
terms
of
all
facets
you
know
we
working
closely
with
the
arts
commission
and
so
we
have
a
full
this
is
something
that
we
will
continue
to
expand
upon
but
in
terms
of
purposeful
program
within
or
juvenile
halls
whatever
plan
also
calls
for
us
to
change
as
a
chief
who
too
is
changing
the
staff
ratio
which
currently
or
staffing
ratio
is
at
one
to
eight
that's
the
prior
the
prison
rape
elimination
act
recommendation
an
we're
proposing
a
one
to
five
which
we
need
to
fully
that
it
also
calls
for
us
to
have
a
crisis
stabilization
unit
that
i
know
doctor
constant
after
strike
we'll
talk
more
about
and
then
one
of
the
things
it
also
calls
for
us
to
do
is
to
develop
apolosi
unit
within
a
juvenile
whole
we've
contractid
with
a
national
expert
mike
dempsey
he's
the
executive
director
for
the
council
of
juvenile
correctional
administrators
and
his
partner
is
julie
wolford
who
is
with
georgetown
to
do
the
evaluation
for
us
because
as
we
move
forward
with
our
elimination
plan
who
want
to
evaluate
you
know
doing
the
internet
evaluation
what's
working
with
things
that
we
need
to
shift
with
things
that
we
need
to
meet
more
aggressive
in
thank
you
so
as
chief
mitchell
discussed
really
the
overarching
goals
of
all
the
involved
apartments
are
to
increase
purposeful
programming
and
treatment
opportunities
and
really
create
a
culture
of
care
for
using
the
juvenile
halls
in
order
to
do
that
we
can
promote
constructive
use
of
their
time
and
help
them
flourish
and
we
really
want
to
try
to
offer
a
full
spectrum
of
meaningful
opportunities
things
like
competitive
recreation
vocational
training
service
oriented
volunteering
or
employment
and
other
opportunities
and
some
of
them
are
listed
up
on
the
slide
i
won't
go
through
them
step
by
step
but
sure
you
can
read
them
and
then
as
far
as
mental
health
collaboration
an
enhancement
and
presents
presents
and
services
i
think
kind
of
one
of
the
principles
is
that
we
want
to
really
proactively
identify
youth
that
have
high
mental
health
needs
an
have
a
higher
risk
of
escalation
of
symptoms
and
really
intensively
intervene
early
in
collaboratively
among
all
the
agencies
and
we
think
that
by
doing
so
we
can
provide
better
treatment
decrease
the
likelihood
of
incidents
occuring
that
might
lead
to
use
of
OC
spray
or
other
uses
of
force
and
really
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
prevent
escalation
and
i
kind
of
think
of
it
as
a
kind
of
upstream
to
downstream
approach
running
from
interventions
that
are
less
less
restrictive
so
maybe
a
bit
more
restrictive
it's
not
perfectly
captured
in
order
on
the
slide
but
the
things
that
were
pursuing
right
now
and
plan
to
pursue
in
the
future
hopefully
our
enhanced
training
so
we
have
some
academic
partners
that
were
working
with
including
UCLA
that
is
doing
a
landscape
survey
and
interviews
with
different
stakeholders
in
the
juvenile
halls
and
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
perceived
needs
are
from
a
from
a
training
an
other
perspectives
and
treatment
perspectives
and
i
think
that
this
will
help
help
us
develop
curricula
that
may
help
are
probation
officers
are
mental
health
staff
morlaco
staff
for
juvenile
court
health
services
staff
and
others
that
are
working
in
the
settings
and
then
enhanced
department
mental
health
staffing
we're
really
thinking
that
ideally
we'd
like
to
have
two
mental
health
staff
for
unit
and
increase
the
time
that
were
available
to
use
waking
hours
we
could
have
once
they
have
engaging
in
individual
therapy
another
running
groups
or
helping
with
any
kind
of
crisis
D
escalation
that
may
happen
freeze
stuff
up
do
multi
disciplinary
treatment
teams
as
well
so
that's
one
of
the
things
that
were
going
to
be
asking
for
and
then
obviously
the
expansion
of
the
multi
disciplinary
treatment
teams
so
that
everyone
's
on
the
same
page
we
can
identify
problems
that
are
happening
before
they
escalate
an
identify
use
that
may
be
struggling
an
increase
the
intensity
of
interventions
for
those
use
and
everyone
will
be
on
the
same
page
probation
G
C
H
S
D
M
H
and
then
a
little
bit
further
downstream
were
planning
on
developing
and
what
we
call
resource
teams
which
will
be
done
in
a
similar
model
to
the
DMH
sheriff
collaborative
of
met
teams
and
so
these
will
be
individuals
will
be
specially
trained
in
crisis
the
escalation
if
units
death
or
unable
to
deescalate
a
given
situation
these
individuals
be
available
twenty
four
seven
to
come
out
and
try
to
assist
with
that
and
then
chief
mitchell
eluded
to
the
crisis
stabilization
units
and
we
would
propose
establishing
one
at
each
hall
and
these
would
really
be
short-term
twenty
three
hour
medically
staffed
medical
model
therapeutic
mill
use
that
would
be
designed
for
kind
of
short
term
intervention
stabilizing
use
getting
them
back
to
the
living
units
as
quickly
as
possible
an
hopefully
preventing
the
need
to
transfer
to
outside
hospital
or
some
kind
of
facility
like
that
so
those
are
some
of
the
things
that
were
looking
at
in
collaboration
with
probation
to
try
to
address
the
increased
mental
health
needs
good
morning
the
elimination
of
the
OC
consists
of
gradual
four
step
program
the
model
was
created
with
the
safety
of
our
staff
and
our
kids
as
top
priority
the
excuse
me
the
units
have
been
clustered
in
faces
based
on
data
that
was
reviewed
related
to
OC
usage
and
assault
on
staff
the
first
phase
consists
of
training
program
in
assessment
during
this
phase
we're
going
to
quote
mentor
monitor
our
staff
were
going
to
enhance
programming
in
collaboration
with
our
partner
agencies
and
R
C
B
O
's
in
the
next
day
of
stage
staff
only
two
staff
or
have
OC
per
shift
stage
three
the
OC
will
be
secured
in
lock
box
in
the
unit
and
available
during
emergencies
only
we
will
make
sure
that
in
each
in
each
stage
our
staff
and
our
kids
are
comfortable
before
we
move
to
the
final
stage
of
complete
OC
elimination
each
stage
has
more
last
between
thirty
and
sixty
days
however
depending
on
our
data
our
analysis
are
feedback
from
our
partner
agencies
in
our
staff
the
stage
could
last
little
longer
or
it
could
also
move
quicker
to
the
following
stage
the
next
slide
will
provide
examples
of
our
schedule
so
this
tentative
schedule
is
for
berry
JB
we
also
have
a
schedule
for
central
juvenile
ha
as
you
can
see
from
this
stage
the
units
with
the
least
amount
of
OC
spray
usage
will
be
the
first
to
begin
the
face
out
each
unit
will
be
evaluated
independently
by
our
outside
consultants
an
i
support
team
to
ensure
that
they
are
ready
to
move
in
to
the
next
stage
we
will
receive
feedback
again
from
everyone
involved
on
september
first
all
staff
will
no
longer
be
required
to
carry
OC
spray
on
their
person
and
that's
when
we
actually
start
our
face
out
process
so
in
in
terms
of
establishing
the
foundation
and
we've
already
begun
training
at
many
of
our
staff
when
non
crisis
prevention
techniques
we've
had
like
twenty
staff
that
got
certified
to
teach
that
class
but
we're
doing
some
additional
training
and
what
we
asked
and
we've
done
some
listening
sessions
in
our
juvenile
holes
in
our
camps
we
have
secure
boxes
we've
done
some
town
hall
meetings
still
more
to
come
asking
you
know
in
observing
staff
and
with
our
consultant
what
are
the
tools
that
are
staffed
clearly
need
to
have
as
we
phase
at
OC
spray
so
one
of
the
tools
that
one
of
the
trainings
which
is
is
that
a
training
that
we
traditionally
have
done
for
juvenile
hall
staff
it's
about
motivational
interviewing
as
chief
mcdonald
was
describing
most
of
our
kids
that
are
in
juvenile
hold
their
pre
adjudicated
the
majority
of
them
and
it's
a
very
challenging
time
for
them
and
so
our
work
is
to
find
out
you
know
where
they
are
in
for
a
staff
to
meet
the
kids
where
they
are
so
that
we
can
help
motivate
them
to
get
rid
of
the
need
to
be
so
motivational
interviewing
is
that
as
a
tool
that
my
probation
officers
use
but
we're
introducing
that
to
our
staff
within
juvenile
whole
also
as
i
think
reported
numerous
times
about
who
are
children
are
so
we're
doing
more
training
in
terms
of
adolescent
development
so
if
your
brand
new
staff
person
you
going
through
the
academy
you're
going
to
get
that
training
how
however
some
of
our
existing
stuff
i've
never
received
that
training
and
it's
so
important
because
it
kind
of
grounds
understanding
who
are
children
are
trauma
informed
care
and
we
we
know
that's
a
critical
piece
as
a
you
know
a
great
number
of
percentage
of
our
kids
have
had
some
type
of
traumatic
experience
in
your
life
one
of
the
things
that
we
want
to
bring
forward
for
a
staff
to
is
the
notion
of
vicarious
trauma
or
what's
known
also
as
compassionate
fatigue
if
you're
working
in
a
facility
for
years
and
years
and
years
it
it
becomes
challenging
because
our
kids
can
challenges
and
so
it
really
is
to
help
our
staff
understand
to
be
able
to
see
these
children
as
the
children
they
are
but
to
give
them
tools
and
support
that
the
staff
need
as
well
and
then
in
terms
of
some
of
the
other
training
that
we're
doing
is
about
behavior
management
it's
about
the
physical
intervention
a
new
use
of
force
polisy
we
just
finalize
that
training
will
start
with
the
management
team
we
go
through
that
training
and
next
next
month
it's
starting
with
the
exact
team
then
with
our
directors
and
managers
and
being
rolled
out
it's
also
another
training
about
then
how
do
you
apply
the
tools
and
techniques
that
are
kind
of
in
our
in
our
use
of
force
polisy
and
so
other
things
that
we've
done
in
our
site
visits
what
we
notice
in
some
facilities
across
the
country
they
really
have
focused
on
employee
wellness
some
facilities
have
gyms
with
our
staff
we
don't
think
of
that
as
being
important
but
staff
told
us
how
important
that
is
so
we're
looking
at
how
to
bring
that
forward
in
what
we
learned
at
some
counties
that
they
get
they
get
donations
from
some
of
the
fitness
centers
so
we're
looking
at
that
the
peer
support
network
that
was
established
last
year
to
continue
with
that
and
then
our
safety
committee
and
so
our
training
as
we
roll
out
this
training
and
what
we
did
with
campus
kilpatrick
the
training
was
comprised
probation
staff
DMH
staff
laco
staff
and
our
community
partners
that
is
the
same
way
that
we
intend
to
roll
out
training
here
as
we
phase
that
OC
spraying
and
so
so
supervisors
this
is
probably
from
my
perspective
the
most
complicated
part
of
the
discussion
other
than
the
time
frame
the
boarded
asked
us
to
do
this
by
the
end
of
the
year
and
i
think
that
that
was
an
appropriate
ask
to
ask
us
to
go
exponentially
when
we
started
to
look
at
all
the
steps
it
was
going
to
take
though
we
couldn't
meet
that
expectation
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
we
need
to
work
with
the
CEO
's
office
to
figure
out
what
is
the
right
ratio
we
proposed
a
five
to
one
ratio
based
on
some
national
recommendations
and
also
based
on
what
we've
done
in
the
LA
model
in
the
LA
model
it
campus
kilpatrick
in
our
camps
we
run
into
six
to
one
ratio
but
the
reality
of
is
the
kids
in
the
hall
have
more
profound
needs
i
don't
know
ultimately
where
will
land
and
i
struggled
with
do
we
go
ahead
and
present
it
at
this
level
understanding
that
it
was
going
to
create
some
criticism
but
i
thought
it
was
best
to
just
be
transparent
about
it
understanding
that
this
is
a
target
we
may
not
be
able
to
achieve
in
my
staff
need
to
understand
that
as
well
we've
been
talking
for
a
while
about
a
DP
oh
three
which
is
really
experienced
probation
officer
as
i
mentioned
earlier
the
halls
are
currently
in
entry
level
place
for
our
employees
what
we've
been
working
with
the
CEO
's
office
in
our
labor
partners
is
a
career
pathway
within
the
halls
so
that
some
experience
stays
there
and
help
staff
development
case
management
skills
and
engagement
skills
and
so
one
of
those
is
establishing
three
DP
oh
three
at
each
of
the
holes
for
training
program
development
compliance
with
our
behavior
management
program
really
serving
as
a
peer
or
a
leader
mentor
for
our
new
employees
the
second
one
is
a
DP
oh
two
treatment
and
counseling
position
those
are
the
staff
that
we
currently
use
at
kirby
dorothy
kirby
center
who
are
masters
level
DP
oh
twos
these
are
the
folks
that
would
work
with
our
partners
in
DMH
much
like
the
sheriff's
met
teams
that
they're
responding
to
youth
and
crises
there
well
trained
to
do
that
they're
also
working
with
our
employees
to
help
teach
deescalation
techniques
we'd
like
permission
to
upgrade
fifty
six
of
our
detention
services
officers
two
DPO
ones
to
create
that
career
pathway
within
the
whole
stabilizing
in
creating
growth
and
learning
opportunities
training
we
wanted
to
a
massive
investment
in
training
and
i
think
the
boards
also
asked
us
to
do
a
massive
investment
in
training
to
prepare
the
two
halls
and
pull
people
off
post
for
all
of
the
hours
of
training
that
we
need
to
provide
is
going
to
be
a
pretty
expensive
one
time
cost
and
then
what
we
want
to
do
is
currently
we're
funded
for
twenty
four
hours
of
training
annually
within
our
halls
in
camps
we
really
need
to
go
to
forty
hours
where
we're
pulling
people
off
post
we're
teaching
them
not
just
about
all
the
stuff
that
miss
mitchell
talked
about
but
prior
emergency
response
escape
response
handling
grievances
we
need
our
folks
to
be
able
to
focus
during
that
training
it's
one
of
the
biggest
criticisms
are
employees
have
had
if
we
talked
about
this
transition
the
facilities
they
do
not
meet
our
expectation
or
i
think
the
boards
expectation
of
what
our
facilities
should
look
like
whether
it's
the
institutional
design
of
the
facilities
or
just
the
bedding
in
the
mattress
is
in
the
tables
and
the
TV
's
we've
tried
not
the
TV
's
i'm
sorry
the
group
space
we've
tried
incrementally
to
clean
up
units
i
think
we've
shared
some
of
those
but
we
need
to
really
do
a
massive
run
through
of
these
facilities
so
when
a
young
person
enters
our
facility
it
doesn't
add
additional
trauma
and
it
feels
more
like
a
treatment
space
than
a
local
jail
we
do
not
know
the
cost
of
that
in
the
long
run
we're
going
to
have
to
work
with
the
CEO
's
office
in
ourselves
to
do
that
and
so
it's
generally
kind
of
soup
to
nuts
training
enhancements
of
staff
so
we
have
more
staff
to
do
programming
renovation
of
facilities
mattress
is
oh
and
i
skipped
radios
we've
procured
radios
this
is
a
pretty
pretty
inexpensive
thing
for
us
to
just
program
them
thank
you
and
as
you
can
tell
from
this
slide
in
order
to
provide
what
i
think
we
would
see
as
ideal
care
from
a
mental
health
perspective
more
also
going
to
need
a
significant
infusion
of
steven
resources
in
our
finance
department
is
getting
us
a
final
total
soon
the
number
of
items
is
fairly
close
to
what
probation
will
be
requesting
but
on
the
order
of
three
hundred
a
little
bit
over
to
do
the
things
that
we
would
like
to
do
which
is
providing
six
AM
to
ten
PM
coverage
seven
days
a
week
with
two
therapists
on
each
unit
staff
these
the
resource
teams
that
i
mentioned
earlier
crisis
stabilization
unit
one
for
each
hall
and
then
a
psychiatrist
item
or
two
to
psychiatrist
items
to
staff
the
csus
and
the
resource
teams
and
all
turn
it
back
over
to
chief
mitchell
so
so
we're
we're
just
extremely
grateful
to
all
that
have
contributed
in
the
creation
of
this
plan
we've
had
a
series
of
meetings
with
or
public
defender
lake
O
D
M
H
O
I
G
or
helping
us
vet
really
comprehensive
plan
we've
worked
with
our
consultant
on
this
plan
so
but
what
we
know
is
that
there's
still
much
more
work
to
do
in
terms
of
engagement
but
we
have
a
plan
in
front
of
you
that
is
it
is
a
it's
a
comprehensive
plan
and
will
address
the
critical
needs
to
help
us
phase
out
OC
spray
successfully
and
create
our
centers
of
excellence
thank
you
OK
thank
you
for
that
presentation
we
have
my
colleagues
would
like
to
say
something
and
ask
questions
i'm
going
to
give
it
back
to
supervisor
kewl
since
this
was
the
item
that
you
held
then
we'll
go
to
visor
barger
and
then
supervisor
so
lease
and
then
supervisor
really
thomas
madam
chair
thank
you
very
much
the
presentation
was
very
complete
we've
been
over
the
report
several
times
and
i've
sort
of
a
couple
of
particular
thoughts
about
this
in
a
couple
of
more
general
thoughts
ever
since
i
was
elected
and
sort
of
came
into
the
middle
of
discussions
about
juvenile
the
juvenile
part
of
probation
i
think
we
have
been
long
on
ideas
on
fixes
an
short
on
funding
that
is
short
on
providing
funding
um
anne
i
didn't
realize
sort
of
the
depth
of
the
culture
change
that
was
necessary
and
i
don't
mean
this
as
a
critique
because
when
i
was
in
the
assembly
and
then
in
the
senate
and
three
of
us
were
there
together
there
was
a
profound
shift
during
that
time
at
starting
before
we
are
election
from
care
and
understanding
and
education
ETC
for
young
people
who
had
offended
to
treating
them
like
adults
locking
them
up
and
punishing
them
and
i
think
that
are
probation
department
over
the
years
were
responding
and
even
ordered
to
respond
in
a
way
to
this
new
idea
that
are
juveniles
were
more
dangerous
that
they
were
more
serious
things
were
getting
worse
lots
of
gang
involvement
blah
blah
but
it
wasn't
really
different
it
was
really
a
difference
in
attitude
very
much
like
my
experience
in
the
battered
women
's
movement
where
batterers
would
always
say
i
had
no
other
way
really
to
control
this
situation
and
i
think
in
probation
this
is
my
opinion
only
it
looked
to
me
like
this
was
the
kind
of
the
same
thing
we
need
to
have
very
serious
ways
of
controlling
this
behavior
this
board
had
different
ideas
and
the
first
thing
we
wanted
to
do
was
to
end
sala
terry
confinement
for
juveniles
and
there
was
a
lot
of
pushback
from
the
probation
officers
at
the
line
level
what
do
we
do
with
we
can't
lock
them
up
for
awhile
till
they
cool
down
etc
and
we
even
got
reports
that
some
of
the
shoes
the
doors
were
removed
which
from
my
experience
in
other
elected
offices
was
a
way
of
over
doing
something
to
make
it
fail
so
that
you
could
say
you
see
i
told
you
they
were
dangerous
and
now
we
can't
control
them
an
we've
seen
some
portion
of
probation
officers
here
at
the
board
telling
us
how
threatened
they
feel
how
dangerous
the
kids
are
and
then
we
went
again
and
said
i
don't
care
we
don't
want
you
using
this
it's
called
pepper
spray
that
makes
it
sound
way
too
little
it's
much
worse
than
anything
that's
like
pepper
or
like
spray
i
mean
it's
awful
and
we
should
know
you've
got
to
stop
it
so
i
think
your
report
shows
to
us
in
a
very
responsible
way
we
want
to
do
this
and
we
will
do
this
but
we
can't
just
say
to
our
probation
officers
OK
now
you
do
one
eighty
and
we
expect
that
you
know
exactly
how
to
do
the
one
eighty
with
the
probation
officers
have
said
to
us
is
we
don't
we're
sorry
we
have
not
been
trained
to
do
this
one
eighty
and
i
wonder
all
the
always
at
that
but
we've
seen
it
in
other
departments
to
wear
attitudes
have
to
change
and
eventually
they
do
our
job
is
to
lead
and
to
try
to
envision
and
to
point
out
your
job
is
to
implement
in
this
report
is
about
implementation
i
am
very
supportive
of
training
and
it's
training
beyond
just
pepper
spray
it's
training
about
deescalation
it's
training
in
something
new
straits
what
keeps
talking
about
it's
really
how
do
i
do
this
without
beating
them
up
how
do
i
do
this
without
twisting
their
arms
how
do
i
do
this
and
we're
saying
there
are
ways
people
have
done
it
and
we
want
you
to
learn
show
the
question
is
the
price
tag
and
i
think
the
report
is
very
responsible
in
identifying
ways
in
which
we
can
get
to
what
the
supervisors
have
said
do
this
and
some
will
agree
with
the
price
tag
and
some
will
not
and
i
think
there
you
know
there
are
rules
i
mean
i
think
public
defenders
here
because
their
role
is
more
than
any
of
us
to
really
represent
these
young
people
absolutely
and
you
know
be
absolutely
on
their
side
with
no
other
responsibility
except
being
on
their
side
and
invoking
the
law
so
i
don't
know
how
we
go
about
measure
my
thinking
about
what
we
can
do
because
we
did
a
couple
of
enhancements
last
year
for
the
department
a
couple
more
on
the
way
but
if
we
are
really
to
be
serious
about
some
aspect
of
this
training
really
do
it
and
if
the
probation
officers
will
participate
and
not
just
say
i'm
in
danger
i'm
in
danger
you
know
give
me
back
my
spray
i
think
we
can
eventually
get
there
but
i
don't
know
what
to
do
honestly
about
the
price
tag
you
presented
us
with
a
plan
two
years
ago
that
had
a
lot
to
do
with
training
and
miss
mitchell
as
well
and
we
didn't
do
really
very
much
with
it
so
i
want
to
ask
after
our
conversation
i'm
sorry
miss
emma
who
shaking
her
head
saying
we
did
something
with
it
OK
good
then
i
think
that
would
be
good
for
us
to
know
and
try
to
figure
out
can
we
help
the
department
get
to
where
we
want
them
to
be
holding
feet
to
the
fire
and
soul
has
given
us
you
know
a
good
way
of
looking
at
it
and
the
print
and
the
probation
commission
to
come
so
i
think
we
need
a
plan
for
this
next
year
maybe
something
for
final
changes
to
look
at
and
think
about
how
to
get
to
this
outcome
thank
you
madam
chair
thank
you
supervisor
cool
supervisor
barger
well
first
of
all
i
want
to
thank
you
all
for
this
report
and
the
one
thing
that
jumps
out
at
me
is
when
i
look
at
this
and
i
know
i
agree
with
user
cool
if
you
don't
provide
the
proper
tools
and
training
i
don't
take
OC
spray
out
of
it
take
that
whole
debate
out
of
it
we
should
be
providing
this
to
these
children
in
our
custody
right
now
and
you
know
i
look
to
mental
help
and
i
just
have
to
wonder
how
many
have
been
not
diagnosed
going
in
that
may
have
some
mental
health
issues
whether
it
be
based
on
the
trauma
or
if
in
fact
they
do
have
mental
health
challenges
that
have
not
been
diagnosed
and
then
the
question
comes
up
we
get
back
to
the
whole
community
based
services
and
if
we
are
going
to
be
front
loading
mental
help
which
i
completely
wholeheartedly
believe
we
should
and
you
know
when
i
tell
people
's
mental
health
is
not
just
you
know
people
think
of
schizophrenia
being
manic
but
in
fact
depression
is
a
form
of
mental
health
and
when
you
look
at
the
trauma
informed
care
i
mean
there
are
a
lot
of
triggers
that
can
cause
that
and
so
i
wholeheartedly
support
this
and
i
really
do
say
you
know
we've
asked
you
to
put
together
a
plan
and
you've
given
us
a
dollar
amount
based
on
the
knowledge
of
not
just
probation
but
of
our
experts
in
mental
health
and
it
is
a
large
amount
of
money
but
at
the
same
time
even
the
ratio
to
me
is
something
that
with
or
without
the
OC
spray
debate
we
need
to
look
at
it
we
need
to
look
at
this
because
the
population
that
we
currently
have
is
far
more
complex
then
then
has
been
in
years
past
and
in
part
it's
because
we
have
not
provided
adequate
resources
to
give
them
the
services
that
they
need
and
some
would
argue
the
dignity
they
deserve
and
i
appreciate
that
i'm
really
happy
at
the
department
has
brought
this
forward
in
an
eye
of
the
supervisor
recognize
that
when
you
look
and
i've
been
out
to
the
camps
which
are
going
to
be
flat
line
and
then
we're
going
to
the
campuses
but
at
the
same
time
we
need
to
work
with
mental
health
on
the
community
based
side
because
the
reality
is
that
when
these
children
are
released
from
our
care
or
custody
we're
going
to
need
to
put
them
in
the
community
and
ensure
that
they
get
a
continued
continuation
of
the
services
that
we're
providing
and
it's
important
that
this
board
recognize
that
that
goes
hand
in
hand
what
we've
been
talking
about
when
we
were
talking
about
the
jail
and
how
we're
going
to
make
sure
that
there
are
services
in
the
community
because
i
think
we
would
all
agree
you
know
i
know
that
when
when
i
had
loved
one
in
the
hospital
the
doctors
said
they're
going
to
heal
better
outside
the
hospital
and
they
are
in
the
hospital
even
though
it's
counter
counter
intuitive
i
would
argue
the
same
thing
here
we
need
to
look
at
these
children
recognize
that
it's
not
just
when
we
have
them
in
our
custody
but
when
they
are
released
'cause
they
will
be
released
out
into
the
community
and
if
we
want
to
make
sure
they
don't
end
up
going
through
our
system
again
we
need
to
make
sure
we
frontally
low
those
services
so
again
you
know
i
really
do
believe
that
we
can
be
penny
wise
and
pound
foolish
as
it
relates
to
nickel
and
diming
probation
on
rolling
this
out
but
this
board
has
said
OC
spray
is
going
to
be
no
longer
available
i
think
it's
unfair
to
our
probation
staff
not
to
properly
train
him
an
again
i
keep
saying
take
out
OC
spray
i
think
we
should
have
been
training
them
on
this
years
ago
OK
because
if
you
talk
to
probation
and
i
think
we've
all
gotten
letters
from
from
the
union
have
talked
about
the
difficulty
of
the
kids
coming
in
and
they
don't
feel
their
properly
train
well
now
we're
going
to
give
them
the
training
and
you
know
i
would
ask
cheap
mcdonald
that
we
get
quarterly
updates
as
it
relates
to
how
the
training
is
rolling
out
i
think
it's
important
for
us
to
understand
how
staff
is
receiving
it
but
more
importantly
how
it's
playing
out
in
our
halls
in
our
camp
because
to
your
point
i
don't
have
you
set
it
terry
said
it
that
they're
going
to
claim
they're
not
getting
enough
training
i
think
it's
important
for
us
to
be
very
much
on
top
of
that
and
then
and
then
do
an
exit
interview
to
planet
is
it
sufficient
what
do
we
do
what
do
we
need
to
do
what
are
we
missing
because
the
goal
is
to
eliminate
OC
spray
i
think
this
board
collectively
all
agrees
with
that
i
think
was
one
hundred
percent
behind
that
but
for
me
it's
more
about
the
holistic
care
of
these
children
in
our
system
and
recognizing
that
they're
there
for
a
reason
person
form
they
are
there
for
a
reason
but
that
reason
doesn't
mean
that
they're
treated
any
less
than
we
do
with
our
children
that
we
make
sure
get
a
loving
home
that
are
in
our
foster
care
system
because
they
are
our
children
and
it's
important
for
us
to
provide
all
the
resources
necessary
to
make
sure
that
when
they
leave
our
system
they
are
on
a
path
it's
a
far
better
path
then
under
the
old
system
so
you
know
but
again
i
i
know
it's
a
large
amount
of
money
sachi
but
when
you
look
at
what's
going
on
with
the
culture
of
the
probation
department
and
all
that
i
think
that
we
as
a
board
need
to
prioritize
and
triage
what's
important
and
i
you
know
the
investments
we've
made
have
shown
and
you've
shown
with
your
allocation
of
funding
that
this
is
a
priority
but
i
want
to
thank
especially
mental
help
and
probation
for
working
on
this
because
you
know
we
talk
about
breaking
down
the
silos
and
this
is
a
classic
example
of
where
working
together
is
what
it's
all
about
and
it
makes
our
system
more
responsive
and
i
would
argue
better
so
i
take
my
hat
off
to
you
thank
you
thank
you
supervisor
solis
i
would
just
say
that
the
reports
that
have
been
provided
to
us
by
print
and
probation
are
really
have
to
say
overwhelming
there's
so
much
information
and
so
much
data
and
so
much
that
i
still
don't
know
that
i
want
to
ask
and
i
want
to
i
want
to
thank
all
of
you
for
playing
a
big
role
here
and
i
know
there's
some
reforms
that
have
already
taken
place
although
be
it
may
be
at
a
smaller
level
and
we
need
to
expand
that
and
i've
seen
some
success
is
already
at
at
eastlake
i
will
point
that
out
but
nowhere
near
where
we
need
to
be
and
i
know
this
is
going
to
cost
us
in
one
way
but
but
i
also
want
to
take
a
very
careful
view
it
at
where
we
put
this
money
so
i
really
do
agree
that
we
need
to
beef
up
our
supervision
or
training
of
our
probation
officers
those
that
want
to
go
up
and
be
mentors
and
coaches
i
think
that's
a
good
incentive
to
have
because
i
have
met
people
that
do
want
to
play
that
role
in
our
capable
and
i'm
sure
we
can
help
provide
whatever
further
educational
assistance
and
training
interacting
both
with
mental
health
and
with
community
community
for
me
is
also
very
big
having
cultural
competency
in
everything
we
do
whether
it's
the
person
who's
distributing
the
medison
in
the
morning
pills
to
the
kids
to
the
nurse
to
the
mental
health
to
the
mentors
so
everyone
i
think
has
to
partake
in
that
kind
of
training
because
you
may
have
some
really
great
professionals
in
the
health
and
the
health
arena
they
have
never
really
dealt
with
this
particular
youth
population
and
i
want
someone
to
address
the
notion
that
these
are
somehow
i've
heard
stated
the
worst
i
want
to
hear
what
that
really
means
we're
finding
that
we're
reducing
our
population
we're
getting
some
of
these
cases
that
are
extremely
difficult
but
i'm
not
sure
if
it's
all
because
their
act
maybe
they're
acting
out
maybe
it's
their
medication
maybe
it's
because
we
haven't
diagnosed
exactly
what
it
is
that
they
have
and
we're
not
addressing
that
so
i
want
to
get
to
that
in
some
way
and
i
also
want
to
hear
what
we're
doing
with
the
outside
community
'cause
i
agree
that
we
need
we
do
have
to
have
some
intervention
happening
in
our
communities
whether
these
children
are
out
on
probation
what
are
we
really
doing
to
engage
those
individuals
or
seabios
that
have
lived
experience
that
again
cultural
competency
and
experience
can
lend
some
assistance
there
and
also
what
that
means
for
those
individuals
having
access
to
our
halls
and
being
made
available
before
there
is
something
that's
going
to
come
up
we
ought
to
be
thinking
about
prevention
in
a
big
way
and
prevention
can
be
very
very
slight
but
very
meaningful
to
someone
whether
it's
to
help
deescalate
the
two
just
as
an
example
two
individuals
that
are
coming
from
different
gangs
are
in
the
same
quad
or
unit
somebody
should
know
and
have
their
radar
on
about
what
that
means
and
understanding
fully
and
interviewing
these
children
and
getting
that
sense
in
their
background
and
sometimes
i
think
people
are
just
mark
in
the
box
and
i
really
think
that
there
has
to
be
more
intervention
more
intent
and
that
means
i
guess
looking
at
looking
at
it
in
a
different
way
is
really
thinking
that
there
are
care
were
charged
to
work
with
them
to
help
them
whether
it's
healing
educating
them
getting
them
back
on
get
on
there
getting
on
their
feet
but
many
of
them
i
hate
to
say
have
had
very
traumatic
experiences
that
isn't
going
to
get
fixed
sometimes
in
the
short
amount
of
time
that
there
with
us
even
if
it's
for
six
months
maybe
i've
heard
from
some
youngsters
that
they
they
actually
feel
that
this
is
a
safer
place
for
them
because
we
haven't
figured
out
that
once
they
leave
us
there's
nowhere
to
go
then
they
come
right
back
in
the
recycle
and
we've
seen
those
cases
so
i
really
want
to
make
sure
that
we're
tracking
all
that
that
we
fully
understand
with
that
child
's
needs
are
and
the
frustration
that
i
have
heard
from
some
of
those
youngsters
regarding
wanting
to
up
to
their
adjudication
get
out
go
to
school
what
resources
are
there
what
staffing
from
our
county
office
of
education
really
is
being
provided
for
these
youngsters
and
i
think
staff
that
work
there
have
to
be
in
the
mode
where
they
are
open
to
listening
and
helping
that
child
achieve
their
full
potential
whatever
that
might
be
maybe
it's
getting
a
GE
D
maybe
it's
just
completing
a
class
and
getting
a
passing
grade
because
they've
never
had
that
before
small
but
big
for
that
one
child
big
and
i'm
i'm
trying
to
break
it
down
in
a
way
because
i've
seen
i've
seen
a
lot
of
what
i've
heard
from
the
young
people
that
i've
been
visiting
for
the
last
five
years
at
our
camps
and
i
truly
have
taken
this
sense
that
there's
so
much
more
that
we
can
offer
we
don't
even
know
how
we're
hurting
some
of
these
youngsters
just
by
way
of
how
we
set
things
up
you
know
so
it
is
about
kind
of
taking
those
blocks
down
and
reassessing
an
pudding
pudding
that
all
in
a
different
space
so
they
also
have
input
'cause
i
really
want
to
know
how
much
input
they've
had
do
they
know
about
this
plan
also
the
youngsters
right
we
want
to
ask
that
question
want
to
ask
also
there
their
families
who
come
in
and
visit
them
is
it
working
and
also
the
staff
the
the
probation
officers
would
input
have
they
had
how
meaningful
i
don't
want
to
just
hate
to
say
it
just
put
money
in
for
training
and
check
the
box
off
and
then
nothing
meaningful
is
going
to
change
so
we
want
to
have
buy
in
how
do
you
get
the
buying
you
start
having
a
conversation
and
you
start
talking
to
people
so
i
want
to
hear
from
soul
if
you
could
also
share
with
me
'cause
you
were
out
holding
community
meetings
what
are
people
saying
about
the
status
of
where
we
are
then
i
want
to
ask
ricardo
if
you
could
help
me
address
or
understand
the
children
that
we're
seeing
that
your
folks
are
seen
are
are
they
is
quote
unquote
bad
is
as
some
people
say
what
is
it
what
are
we
missing
here
so
sold
if
you
would
please
thank
you
supervisor
as
you
mentioned
we
had
over
we
held
as
a
probation
reform
and
implementation
team
about
fourteen
meetings
total
over
the
year
and
of
course
the
board
instructed
is
to
have
a
special
hearing
on
this
topic
in
particular
and
as
you
mentioned
regarding
the
constituencies
that
we
need
to
hear
from
we
have
more
than
a
hundred
people
at
that
special
hearing
and
i
would
say
fully
half
of
those
were
probation
officers
or
probation
staff
and
another
half
various
members
from
different
parts
of
the
community
i
think
the
first
message
much
of
what
you've
said
here
resonates
with
the
kinds
of
questions
that
folks
were
trying
to
center
in
those
meetings
or
had
some
impressions
about
i
think
the
first
and
foremost
is
that
the
board
is
in
the
right
direction
in
elevating
justice
reform
broadly
in
a
way
that
turns
off
the
spigot
so
that
less
and
less
children
end
up
in
detention
an
obviously
that
the
diversion
efforts
and
everything
that
we
can
do
to
ensure
that
the
community
based
supports
are
there
that
you
and
supervisor
barger
have
mentioned
have
to
be
where
we
began
that
the
investments
in
prevention
are
going
to
go
much
further
than
trying
to
meet
all
the
challenges
of
as
you
mention
not
just
training
and
retraining
so
we
have
probation
officers
that
said
i
was
trained
at
once
point
at
one
point
on
a
lot
of
different
topics
and
you
need
to
hear
it
more
than
once
then
we
had
technical
experts
say
sometimes
it's
three
times
and
so
the
larger
the
detention
system
is
the
harder
it
is
to
keep
up
with
those
needs
and
so
they
just
wanted
to
affirm
and
asked
the
board
to
double
down
on
that
approach
in
this
county
regarding
your
other
really
critical
question
around
do
we
believe
that
what's
happening
inside
of
the
camps
is
working
right
now
i
think
the
department
has
been
a
really
good
partner
in
acknowledging
an
looking
at
where
some
of
the
needs
are
to
be
able
to
do
a
better
job
and
the
chief
has
said
where
we
need
to
do
a
better
job
and
i
think
that
for
that
focusing
on
not
just
the
programming
but
the
fundamental
connections
between
the
human
beings
that
are
detained
there
or
that
work
there
is
really
important
so
i
want
to
give
a
couple
of
examples
around
a
few
recommendations
where
where
the
report
the
final
report
agrees
with
some
of
our
recommendations
but
where
chief
mitchell
said
to
me
this
is
a
work
in
progress
and
we
want
to
continue
to
work
with
our
partners
one
of
them
is
about
the
staff
needs
we
had
several
recommendations
that
captured
and
synthesize
what
staffs
concerns
were
and
two
supervisor
cules
point
when
the
sala
terry
confinement
decision
was
made
there
was
certainly
a
subset
of
people
that
were
trained
in
a
different
time
period
and
who
had
been
receiving
a
message
that
perhaps
this
was
about
punishment
but
for
the
vast
majority
of
people
it
was
really
a
question
of
can
we
do
a
better
job
of
bringing
us
along
a
staff
when
a
major
policy
shift
like
this
happens
and
i
think
the
same
is
true
around
pepper
spray
and
so
i
want
to
just
highlight
one
of
them
they
the
department
of
health
partners
identified
some
existing
programs
that
have
been
piloted
where
staff
are
able
to
come
in
and
debrief
incidents
on
a
daily
basis
and
to
actually
process
with
DMH
stuff
with
the
probation
supervisors
and
while
we
would
endorse
this
idea
that
these
types
of
programs
in
the
department
does
a
good
job
of
articulating
what
they
are
are
an
important
first
step
of
the
specific
recommendation
was
to
identify
what
barriers
exist
for
staff
to
consistently
participate
in
such
programs
and
to
address
those
obstacles
because
from
probation
and
from
DMH
we
heard
that
often
these
there
are
not
the
level
of
participation
that
people
would
want
even
when
you
have
a
good
idea
in
motion
inside
and
that
probably
has
to
do
with
a
lot
of
complexity
that
the
chief
has
identified
on
the
flip
the
ag
identified
that
even
though
the
vast
majority
of
the
staff
is
operating
i
think
in
this
way
where
they're
trying
to
do
the
best
job
or
a
lot
of
them
really
committed
to
this
as
their
professional
work
over
the
years
because
they
they
really
fell
in
love
with
the
idea
of
transforming
the
conditions
for
the
youth
there
is
a
subset
of
folks
operating
off
of
an
old
culture
that
in
the
words
of
the
IG
report
needs
immediate
and
specific
attention
and
that
that
culture
change
is
not
going
to
change
from
increasing
training
alone
that
that
needs
a
specific
strategy
to
deal
with
identify
with
and
deal
with
whatever
it
is
that
is
allowing
it
to
continue
to
hold
RT
in
a
very
small
population
but
as
you
say
even
a
small
issue
could
have
a
huge
impact
in
the
life
of
a
child
so
for
that
recommendation
we
would
want
to
continue
to
work
with
our
partners
in
probation
to
say
how
do
we
leverage
this
reports
intention
to
bring
in
community
healers
folks
with
the
cultural
competency
that
you're
mentioning
to
actually
be
explicit
around
what
we
think
some
other
factors
are
that
allow
that
to
continue
particularly
if
there's
an
ask
to
increase
the
number
of
resources
and
staff
in
the
facilities
so
we
have
to
address
something
that
the
O
I
G
report
that
you
all
called
for
says
it's
a
significant
contributing
factor
in
a
way
that's
a
little
bit
more
explicit
and
deeper
for
us
to
make
sure
that
we're
not
here
a
few
years
later
saying
we
did
make
investment
and
this
hasn't
gone
away
so
i
just
use
those
as
an
example
to
respond
to
your
immediate
question
there's
a
lot
of
alignment
around
the
recommendations
that
your
appointees
made
around
how
to
phase
out
pepper
spray
namely
that
there
was
a
need
to
go
beyond
the
december
two
thousand
nineteen
deadline
that
you
all
had
identified
based
on
what
our
technical
advisers
were
saying
nobody
's
done
at
this
quickly
and
it
could
harm
youth
and
stuff
the
idea
that
there
needed
to
be
articulated
stages
with
concrete
benchmarks
that
could
tell
us
if
we're
achieving
making
progress
to
achieve
the
final
goal
and
so
in
that
respect
i
think
there
is
a
lot
of
alignment
and
reflection
of
what
the
community
came
and
said
that
at
the
special
hearing
thank
you
thank
you
thank
you
very
much
sorry
super
sweet
thank
you
very
much
for
the
opportunity
speaking
for
all
of
you
and
really
to
all
five
of
you
for
your
real
care
and
the
words
you
say
about
my
clients
these
children
i
mean
it
using
that
language
is
so
important
nobody
other
than
perhaps
the
children
and
their
parents
are
more
invested
in
their
well
being
and
the
removal
of
OC
spray
from
these
facilities
as
well
as
changing
the
culture
in
which
the
children
are
treated
than
i
am
and
my
staff
in
my
team
are
they
are
there
every
day
working
with
these
young
men
and
women
and
hearing
from
them
directly
about
what
the
experience
in
what
they
see
in
the
halls
perhaps
in
a
way
that
no
other
adult
advocate
let's
use
those
words
here's
and
i
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
be
able
to
share
that
experience
with
you
you
asked
a
very
important
question
supervisor
about
the
children
who
they
are
and
i
think
and
i
don't
think
it
is
we
are
operating
sometimes
from
this
false
idea
that
some
of
these
children
other
worst
of
the
worst
or
somehow
they
are
now
worse
than
they've
ever
been
before
and
we're
in
a
unique
setting
because
of
who
they
are
and
that's
just
not
true
these
children
that
are
being
spoken
about
as
the
worst
of
the
worst
have
always
been
part
of
the
juvenile
justice
system
they've
always
been
in
the
facilities
the
difference
we
see
now
is
it
because
of
the
work
of
our
legislature
of
this
board
and
even
of
the
probation
department
most
of
the
young
people
that
we've
identified
that
should
not
be
detained
and
caged
have
been
removed
from
the
halls
and
so
the
larger
numbers
the
thousands
that
we
used
to
know
where
in
the
halls
are
gone
and
so
we're
left
with
a
smaller
number
eight
hundred
and
it
may
appear
on
its
surface
at
these
other
words
words
but
again
they
are
not
they
are
no
different
than
the
kids
that
have
been
there
all
this
time
they
just
in
my
honest
opinion
make
an
easy
scapegoat
point
the
finger
at
the
person
that
is
being
traumatized
and
perhaps
we're
not
taking
responsibility
for
the
failure
of
our
cells
as
adults
for
giving
them
the
services
they
need
desperately
want
i
think
it's
important
when
we
look
at
this
report
and
we
look
at
the
changes
that
are
trying
to
be
made
that
i
think
as
soul
said
we
don't
find
ourselves
again
here
in
two
years
asking
the
same
questions
making
articulating
the
same
concerns
because
as
you
know
we've
been
down
this
road
before
we
believe
i
believe
that
the
children
need
a
voice
i
think
soul
again
mentioned
that
the
children
and
their
parents
need
a
voice
they
need
someone
there
speaking
for
them
not
in
the
interest
of
the
department
not
in
the
interest
of
the
board
not
in
the
interest
of
the
workers
or
anyone
else
but
them
and
what
i
think
we're
missing
in
this
conversation
is
that
voice
we
have
offered
to
provide
that
advocates
from
our
department
it's
a
supplement
the
process
to
help
provide
that
and
be
sure
that
what
not
to
point
the
finger
at
probation
if
it's
doing
something
wrong
but
the
come
and
tell
you
what
the
children
feel
is
working
what
is
not
to
come
and
tell
you
whether
this
process
is
moving
at
an
adequate
pace
or
we
making
excuses
so
that
we
can
avoid
talking
about
this
again
in
two
years
i
would
love
nothing
more
two
years
from
now
as
your
public
defender
to
sit
here
and
praise
the
department
for
having
removed
OC
spray
change
the
culture
and
said
we
took
a
herculean
leap
successfully
i
do
not
want
to
be
here
two
years
from
now
saying
and
my
kids
why
are
they
still
being
abused
why
are
they
still
being
mistreated
and
i
think
each
of
you
would
prefer
that
as
well
and
so
i
thank
you
for
the
update
answer
that
question
but
i
repeat
it
these
children
are
no
worse
and
the
children
have
been
in
the
halls
at
any
other
time
and
we
must
change
from
our
lexecon
the
vilification
of
those
who
were
taken
care
of
at
any
expense
thank
you
for
the
opportunity
thank
you
super
is
really
thomas
madam
chair
and
colleagues
had
simply
wanna
offer
the
following
insights
is
well
established
by
now
that
this
is
not
a
new
problem
the
counties
use
and
some
would
argue
abuse
of
pepper
spray
war
well
documented
by
the
US
department
of
justice
going
back
to
two
thousand
and
three
already
some
fifteen
plus
years
ago
and
i
believe
it's
the
board
's
responsibility
we've
indicated
to
ensure
the
humane
treatment
as
well
as
rehabilitation
let
me
punctuate
the
point
it
is
re
abilitation
that
is
the
mandate
the
mission
of
the
department
of
probation
and
how
could
that
not
be
even
more
important
with
respect
to
youth
and
our
karen
in
our
custody
as
well
as
creating
a
safe
working
environment
for
our
employees
seems
to
me
that
our
approach
has
to
be
comprehensive
this
is
why
we
voted
to
phase
out
pepper
spray
and
remain
committed
to
that
very
act
by
virtue
of
our
conversation
today
appropriate
technology
work
up
the
leadership
of
the
probation
department
after
that
the
inspector
general
as
well
as
the
print
leadership
and
involvement
and
of
course
that
of
the
work
of
the
department
of
mental
health
they've
all
been
working
on
this
issue
probation
has
been
aided
by
these
other
departments
in
an
interdepartmental
pursuit
that
will
make
for
better
outcome
department
of
the
public
defender
ads
that
voice
from
a
legal
perspective
saying
after
all
these
children
in
many
instances
do
have
rights
that
we
are
bound
by
law
to
respect
and
in
some
instances
we
have
los
sight
of
that
i
think
the
office
of
the
inspector
general
's
investigation
into
the
matter
she
had
a
lot
of
light
on
the
problematic
culture
inside
them
juvenile
halls
with
thank
them
for
that
work
again
the
print
which
has
many
of
you
already
know
put
in
many
many
hours
has
to
be
acknowledged
for
that
and
engaging
the
public
on
the
phasing
out
of
peppers
pepper
spray
and
producing
strong
recommendations
i
believe
those
recommendations
will
ultimately
need
to
be
reconciled
with
the
recommendations
from
the
department
report
today
add
to
that
the
additional
insight
so
the
department
of
mental
health
and
so
we
have
much
more
work
to
do
comprehensively
and
as
we
move
tored
the
deadline
that
the
board
has
established
well
it's
already
been
said
we
won't
meet
that
deadline
but
i'm
not
prepared
to
fully
accept
that
we
have
to
work
thoughtfully
diligently
and
keep
moving
with
all
stakeholders
engaged
our
implementation
ought
to
be
set
gotta
be
very
task
oriented
laser
like
focus
data
driven
in
order
to
get
where
we
know
we
should
be
it
must
remain
our
focus
the
changing
the
culture
inside
these
facilities
is
the
order
of
the
day
anything
less
than
that
will
only
compound
problems
that
we
are
articulating
and
less
we
are
able
to
get
our
arms
around
this
i
predict
matters
will
worsen
we
can
ill
afford
that
cost
that
department
has
indicated
of
some
forty
million
dollars
that's
outlined
in
the
plan
we
know
that's
a
significant
amount
of
money
the
scrubbing
of
that
by
the
CEO
has
to
take
place
we
need
to
be
clear
about
whether
or
not
we
are
in
the
middle
of
issues
that
impact
current
negotiations
with
the
department
because
all
of
these
pieces
madam
chair
and
colleagues
have
to
fit
together
especially
at
a
time
when
we
are
downsizing
these
facilities
and
serving
an
increasing
number
of
youth
in
our
communities
we
need
to
be
thoughtful
strategic
anticipating
the
implications
of
our
policy
prescriptions
here
so
i
know
the
result
can
be
a
good
one
the
status
quo
simply
is
untenable
and
in
my
view
blatantly
indefensible
but
fifteen
years
this
has
been
called
to
our
attention
too
little
has
been
done
that
has
to
be
over
we
can
do
better
we
owe
it
to
those
in
our
care
in
our
custard
would
custody
we
owe
it
to
those
who
we
employ
we
owe
it
to
our
selves
so
probation
reformed
no
one
said
it
would
be
easy
it's
a
heavy
lift
but
that's
why
we
use
the
language
of
transparency
of
accountability
commitment
that
says
care
first
as
anyone
heard
that
here
today
this
is
an
emerging
model
and
we
don't
want
to
overwork
it
and
and
supervisor
solis
said
we
need
to
hang
a
batter
in
here
said
carefirst
i
recall
supervisor
kill
then
senator
kewl
chairing
the
senate
health
committee
she
hung
a
banner
in
front
of
her
chairs
desta
said
do
no
harm
seems
to
me
care
for
us
and
do
no
harm
or
bookings
for
the
way
in
which
policies
being
steered
here
and
i
believe
it
to
be
a
good
thing
accountability
madam
chair
transparency
a
commitment
to
a
new
culture
that's
inclusive
that
is
appropriate
that
faces
the
day
with
the
kind
of
insight
that
causes
us
to
be
proud
of
the
work
that
we're
doing
so
i'm
looking
forward
to
the
balance
of
the
work
i'm
looking
forward
to
receiving
the
prints
report
in
the
final
form
that
speaks
to
oversight
absent
that
i
think
you
realize
this
is
all
for
not
no
one
came
to
play
today
no
one
has
time
to
waste
time
is
of
the
essence
to
the
extent
that
we
know
that
to
be
the
case
let's
do
right
by
these
young
people
and
the
people
who
they've
been
entrusted
to
their
care
their
nurturing
their
rehabilitation
seems
to
me
if
we
do
that
we
will
then
be
able
to
say
it's
been
a
good
days
work
madam
chair
thank
you
supervisor
really
thomas
before
i
go
to
super
kewl
just
want
to
add
my
remarks
and
thank
everyone
of
course
for
this
report
on
how
we
might
begin
to
phase
out
an
eliminate
pepper
spray
and
you
know
i
think
that
was
a
bold
move
on
the
part
of
this
board
to
actually
lay
that
down
as
a
mandate
that
we
no
longer
believed
that
that
chemical
should
be
used
against
the
children
that
are
in
our
care
some
of
us
were
shocked
with
the
videos
that
we
saw
of
some
of
our
again
our
our
children
being
sprayed
with
that
horrible
stuff
but
then
it's
like
how
do
we
how
do
we
eliminate
it
how
do
we
ultimately
ban
it
an
what
do
we
put
in
its
place
how
do
we
support
our
staff
as
they
are
facing
challenges
every
single
day
in
our
camps
in
our
halls
and
i
know
some
of
the
probation
staff
could
not
be
here
today
because
they
are
working
on
negotiating
their
contract
we
know
that
their
morale
is
a
bit
low
an
we
also
want
to
make
sure
that
whatever
we
do
we
support
them
i
think
for
me
just
looking
at
this
you
know
i
think
there's
a
little
bit
of
a
shock
to
see
that
are
bold
move
of
wanting
to
eliminate
this
horrible
stuff
came
back
with
a
thirty
nine
million
dollar
price
tag
and
i've
been
told
that
you
add
on
mental
health
price
tag
that's
another
forty
million
sore
about
up
to
eighty
million
i
don't
think
defender
put
a
price
tag
on
his
offering
to
be
the
voice
of
the
children
but
you
know
it's
all
resources
all
resources
an
and
i'll
also
say
for
just
a
first
blush
at
this
i
mean
there's
a
lot
of
these
items
and
terry
you
said
it
is
soup
to
nuts
you
know
sort
of
like
if
you're
going
to
be
in
pepper
spray
here's
all
the
stuff
that
we
think
should
sake
take
place
i
think
some
of
that
stuff
should
take
place
anyway
whether
or
not
we
eliminate
pepper
straight
like
mattresses
and
bed
frames
just
to
provide
the
kind
of
environment
that
is
somewhat
gives
people
dignity
and
respect
i'm
surprised
that
that
came
back
in
this
report
and
that
has
not
been
something
that
was
brought
to
our
attention
before
maybe
it
has
and
i
missed
that
but
that's
something
i
feel
like
we
should
be
doing
anyway
radios
you
said
was
kind
of
a
small
price
tag
again
if
that
was
something
that
you
know
would
help
our
staff
we
should
have
done
that
anyway
now
the
additional
staff
staffing
up
and
the
training
i
think
those
are
critical
but
i
i
feel
like
we
almost
need
to
separate
i
don't
know
if
that's
uh
you
responsibility
to
sort
a
separate
what
we
actually
should
be
doing
anyway
whether
or
not
we
move
forward
in
eliminate
ing
in
banning
pepper
spray
and
if
that's
like
a
separate
price
tag
that
we
could
actually
look
at
to
see
if
there
are
resources
to
provide
those
kinds
of
basic
you
know
you
know
quality
of
life
while
they're
in
our
care
resources
i
don't
disagree
with
you
madam
chair
and
certainly
the
rest
of
the
board
members
with
your
concerns
i
think
couple
things
just
one
is
these
are
issues
that
we
also
need
to
work
with
labor
on
and
as
you
know
the
labor
table
is
still
open
and
so
we
really
mattress
training
in
some
of
the
positions
so
will
be
working
through
with
that
i
mean
there's
certain
things
that
i
wish
we
comes
back
again
i'd
like
to
see
it
a
little
bit
more
things
that
don't
really
relate
to
banning
pepper
spray
right
we
just
we
will
be
working
with
the
department
we
need
an
opportunity
to
really
go
through
and
scrub
the
numbers
i
think
we
could
separate
it
out
as
you
indicated
and
then
go
from
there
i
do
want
to
you
know
just
comment
on
the
finances
and
i
think
everybody
knows
this
i
just
want
to
say
kind
of
the
good
in
the
bad
and
i'll
start
with
a
bad
i
think
one
of
the
pressing
points
we
have
with
the
probation
department
is
the
potential
loss
of
the
title
for
the
waiver
that
right
there
is
twenty
eight
million
dollars
moving
into
fiscal
year
nineteen
twenty
and
with
that
said
you
know
this
adds
potentially
another
thirty
eight
million
dollars
to
the
budget
however
that's
the
bad
part
the
good
part
is
i
think
that
we
can
work
together
and
figure
out
some
potentials
i
can't
say
that
we
can
close
the
gap
for
all
of
it
immediately
not
within
one
year
i
think
we
need
to
be
creative
i
think
the
department
needs
to
be
particularly
creative
on
how
it
could
expedite
some
of
these
things
not
just
as
a
funding
mechanism
but
perhaps
in
other
ways
so
will
be
working
with
the
department
i
think
we
need
to
work
with
our
labor
partners
and
then
certainly
come
back
to
this
board
but
you
will
also
see
during
the
supplemental
budget
that
we
are
trying
to
address
some
of
the
pressing
points
financially
i
think
probation
is
closing
positively
there's
a
little
bit
of
excess
funds
so
that
may
also
help
it's
not
much
but
i
just
had
our
team
pull
kind
of
where
they're
coming
in
but
certainly
we
were
hoping
for
some
savings
in
that
hour
in
that
area
it
might
be
a
tiny
tiny
bit
but
and
again
i
think
that
you
will
recognize
during
our
final
budget
yesterday
revenues
for
the
overall
county
only
went
up
the
locally
generated
revenues
only
went
up
by
four
million
so
hopefully
the
expectation
of
the
board
is
not
that
it's
going
up
real
high
right
well
again
we
really
want
to
work
on
this
we
want
to
get
to
that
point
i
also
i
think
next
time
it
comes
before
we
need
a
better
sense
of
is
this
a
parallel
track
does
one
need
to
happen
before
the
other
how
much
of
one
needs
to
take
place
before
we
feel
like
we
can
actually
eliminate
it
how
much
of
this
needs
to
be
done
and
is
that
is
that
part
of
the
labor
negotiations
or
is
that
just
what
we
think
makes
sense
to
support
our
staff
as
we
ban
it
immediately
that
was
a
little
unclear
to
me
but
i
think
it's
clear
this
board
is
not
going
to
back
down
on
our
belief
that
we
do
want
to
eliminate
this
chemical
from
being
used
against
our
children
in
our
custody
and
all
this
other
requests
we
believe
in
we
think
it's
right
i
mean
but
how
much
of
it
can
be
done
before
we
believe
this
chemical
needs
to
be
illuminated
that's
what
i'd
like
to
see
happen
so
again
thank
you
for
this
my
last
point
is
that
the
training
i
know
when
staff
has
talked
to
me
they
really
wanted
to
emphasize
the
ongoing
training
you
know
not
just
one
time
but
really
a
lot
all
the
time
just
to
keep
keep
it
in
front
of
them
i
think
they
really
want
that
and
felt
like
so
far
that
hasn't
been
part
of
what's
going
on
so
supervisor
cule
a
documented
jerry
a
couple
of
questions
chief
mcdonald
the
uh
grid
that
you
gave
us
about
the
resource
request
summary
my
first
question
is
if
we're
closing
camps
and
all
but
one
or
closing
a
hole
do
we
not
have
personnel
then
that
could
be
it
could
meet
this
one
to
five
ratio
or
are
you
looking
at
two
hundred
and
seventy
one
new
positions
that's
a
good
question
madame
supervisory
i
try
to
always
ask
good
questions
i
didn't
articulate
that
well
there
are
savings
that
we've
generated
from
closures
of
camps
in
the
hole
and
some
of
these
things
were
not
asking
for
money
for
were
just
the
mattresses
i
agree
with
the
supervisor
some
things
were
not
asking
for
money
for
we
just
want
to
folks
to
know
that
we're
spending
the
money
what
we
need
to
do
is
work
with
sashi
's
team
to
really
quantify
the
savings
and
saw
she
mentioned
this
title
for
irevan
ooh
we
were
closing
los
padrinos
to
close
that
gap
and
so
that's
what's
creating
kind
of
this
secondary
challenge
so
yes
the
overall
request
is
nothing
like
this
but
we
need
to
work
with
so
she's
team
'cause
there's
about
less
than
a
thousand
kids
am
i
wrong
or
eight
hundred
between
the
halls
in
camps
so
looking
i
mean
i
think
we
really
need
to
understand
i
understand
people
need
to
be
trained
up
to
do
this
supervision
but
a
lot
of
what
we're
talking
about
is
training
and
not
really
new
personnel
so
in
the
thirty
i
mean
everybody
is
going
to
quote
thirty
nine
million
dollars
and
it
sounds
like
thirty
nine
billion
new
dollars
and
it's
not
new
dollars
but
second
thing
is
it
seems
to
be
very
important
to
begin
whatever
training
is
being
identified
as
soon
as
possible
and
the
third
thing
and
thank
you
madam
chair
for
giving
me
the
second
bite
at
the
apple
i
think
it
would
be
important
for
us
in
looking
at
the
phase
out
of
the
spray
to
have
the
kind
of
report
that
we
get
on
children
have
runaway
children
have
gone
to
the
hospital
because
we
are
told
right
away
and
i
really
appreciate
that
partly
because
it
really
gives
me
a
sense
of
what
probation
is
up
against
it
sort
of
every
day
but
we
know
when
a
child
's
gone
to
the
hospital
we
know
when
a
child
has
run
away
we
know
when
a
child
is
now
back
in
custody
could
we
have
a
report
on
every
use
of
pepper
spray
because
that
will
help
us
see
sort
of
the
phase
out
and
i
guess
i
can't
promise
for
all
of
us
but
i
promise
not
to
jump
on
it
you
know
like
hey
we're
doing
away
with
this
but
it
would
be
good
for
us
to
know
also
be
cause
when
people
know
that
they're
going
to
come
to
our
attention
for
using
it
i
don't
know
it's
an
extra
thing
the
other
thing
is
in
the
phase
out
grid
you
show
different
units
a
tentative
schedule
could
we
have
a
report
back
and
i
think
there
was
already
a
request
for
that
and
maybe
even
matching
to
this
grid
you
know
we
did
phase
it
out
in
unit
AB
we
did
phase
it
out
etc
etc
it's
now
locked
up
or
two
people
have
it
or
whatever
it
would
be
good
for
us
to
know
i
mean
you're
going
to
want
to
know
anyway
and
just
to
let
us
know
i
hope
wouldn't
create
all
that
extra
word
i
want
to
ask
kept
in
terms
of
is
there
any
connection
with
DCFS
and
their
resources
in
terms
of
helping
i
don't
know
this
is
one
of
those
silo
busting
things
because
half
these
kids
are
the
same
kids
you
know
their
foster
kids
and
under
in
juvenile
justice
and
now
they're
out
so
there
back
in
foster
care
so
i
don't
know
whether
you
know
'cause
mental
health
works
with
both
these
departments
but
whether
there's
any
ability
to
i
don't
know
it
wouldn't
say
cost
savings
but
to
help
in
terms
of
the
mental
health
resources
that
are
given
to
these
children
they
may
already
have
someone
working
with
them
through
the
foster
care
system
and
now
suddenly
you
know
there
in
the
camps
now
i
know
mental
health
was
talking
here
about
training
and
what
they
would
do
for
officers
and
that
that
would
not
be
fungible
but
just
thinking
about
the
overall
services
that
are
given
yeah
and
as
you
probably
know
we
have
a
point
the
two
forty
one
point
one
youth
where
both
both
the
department
's
touch
and
i
know
judge
nash
is
doing
a
lot
of
work
around
probation
youth
and
allowing
them
to
access
some
of
the
same
services
DCFS
youth
might
be
able
to
but
we
certainly
would
try
to
interface
with
DCFS
on
release
and
re
entry
into
the
community
and
get
you
hooked
up
with
the
same
therapist
but
so
maybe
that's
something
we
explored
through
those
committees
to
as
far
as
the
funding
issue
final
thing
is
in
an
i'm
sure
mister
garcia
will
agree
one
of
the
things
that
we've
heard
from
the
young
people
themselves
is
that
when
they
are
busy
or
when
they
have
some
kind
of
class
or
when
they
somebody
showing
some
interest
in
them
they
are
far
less
likely
to
kind
of
just
push
back
and
there
was
a
wonderful
video
that
the
sacramento
PBS
station
did
about
our
probation
department
and
the
road
to
success
academies
in
which
the
young
people
were
talking
about
how
much
more
they
got
they
didn't
want
to
be
in
custody
but
they
got
so
much
more
in
custody
than
they
did
when
they
were
home
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
as
an
aspect
of
their
mental
health
the
collaboration
with
lake
oh
and
make
certain
that
there
are
programs
all
the
time
to
keep
them
busy
if
nothing
else
and
the
kind
of
thing
we
envisioned
in
campus
kilpatrick
that
would
actually
develop
some
skills
and
maybe
the
young
women
at
is
it
at
scott
or
shutter
with
you
know
working
with
these
newborn
kittens
thinking
well
they'll
be
veterinary
assistance
or
whatever
all
of
these
things
i
think
are
also
a
deescalation
technique
on
their
side
so
i
don't
need
to
tell
your
business
but
it
just
occurs
to
me
there
are
these
connections
that
would
take
us
to
this
goal
i
think
and
also
resources
we
already
have
in
our
expanding
thank
you
madam
chair
thank
you
any
other
colleagues
wishing
to
say
something
of
not
and
thank
you
very
much
for
your
presentation
i'm
sure
we
have
memories
of
public
that
have
signed
up
to
speak
on
this
item
yes
with
the
fallen
individuals
please

OK
missing
preven
just
joking
it's
her
pregnant
from
the
third
district
now
this
has
been
a
longstanding
problem
it
is
completely
perplexing
how
it's
taken
so
long
to
solve
it
and
you
know
it's
clear
that
we
should
not
replace
pepper
spray
with
with
tasers
i
just
want
to
make
that
clear
because
yesterday
you
prove
to
ten
million
dollars
to
go
for
body
worn
video
from
the
same
company
that
when
the
city
got
the
body
worn
they
stuck
four
thousand
four
hundred
tasers
under
the
jump
seat
and
then
the
city
of
la
got
all
those
tazers
now
those
are
equally
inhumane
and
they
cause
death
so
let's
not
go
there
what
we
should
be
doing
is
training
but
i
can't
understand
if
we
can't
get
the
mental
health
training
video
and
ask
for
more
time
from
the
sheriff
of
the
greatest
county
in
america
to
provide
the
post
training
video
that
his
posts
video
they
made
it
but
nami
signed
off
on
it
if
the
public
can't
look
at
it
and
all
of
our
deputies
have
trained
on
it
well
i
think
we're
wasting
our
time
let's
just
disassemble
the
whole
project
thank
you
next
speaker
please
put
up
the
numbers
thank
you
for
having
me
here
to
commend
also
with
an
service
service
and
collision
i
want
to
operation
department
for
presenting
this
today
and
you
know
bringing
our
report
folder
i
do
have
some
concerns
however
i
feel
that
in
order
for
any
type
of
reform
plan
regarding
face
how
of
chemical
sprays
AOC
sprays
i
feel
like
there
should
be
a
better
way
of
keeping
community
engagement
throughout
the
process
for
example
the
institution
safety
committee
on
the
report
do
not
incorporate
your
families
or
formally
incarcerated
individuals
stakeholders
or
community
groups
while
the
policy
and
training
development
team
does
include
the
input
of
the
consoles
uhm
it
does
not
incorporate
families
or
forming
supervise
incarcerated
stakeholders
or
community
groups
so
i
just
could
this
to
me
is
beyond
just
a
face
of
plan
you
know
it's
the
whole
culture
stuff
and
it
really
is
going
to
come
down
to
like
the
type
of
step
there
were
training
in
the
type
of
stuff
they
were
hiring
and
also
when
it
closed
the
budget
piece
i
just
feel
like
we
close
six
camps
where
is
there
money
we
could
use
that
money
for
the
next
speaker
please
hi
i'm
germany
abarca
intern
from
CDF
so
i
have
two
concerns
one
of
the
concerns
is
the
timeline
for
the
phase
out
in
the
calm
so
that
airline
says
that
will
take
at
most
three
hundred
days
starting
on
september
first
thousand
nineteen
to
achieve
OC
spray
in
the
lock
box
in
the
unit
such
that
it
can
be
illuminated
by
july
first
two
thousand
and
twenty
i
get
the
timeline
also
states
that
it
will
it
can
achieve
this
in
twelve
months
the
department
has
not
clearly
been
able
to
reflect
a
final
time
for
the
implement
implementing
the
final
phrase
other
bannon
reflects
a
substantial
amount
of
uncertainty
for
the
time
of
the
OC
and
logged
boxes
the
department
should
commit
twelve
firm
schedule
my
second
concern
is
that
the
data
for
april
twenty
twenty
nineteen
has
not
been
made
public
in
the
department
website
department
should
make
to
making
all
Q
two
two
thousand
nineteen
date
available
within
one
week
of
the
dose
the
closer
the
quarter
and
to
making
such
data
available
on
the
weekly
basis
thank
you
next
speaker
please
hello
my
name
is
justice
jones
on
with
the
arts
for
incarcerated
youth
network
and
and
i'm
here
to
speak
on
the
issue
about
the
pepper
spray
and
i
feel
i
am
previously
incarcerated
as
well
i
feel
that
we're
speaking
were
speaking
about
this
as
if
it's
a
difficult
solution
but
i
feel
it
comes
with
therapy
for
every
probation
officer
because
their
trauma
too
but
it's
not
a
shared
trauma
with
the
youth
that
they
work
with
a
lot
of
the
times
and
i
feel
and
that's
where
it
doesn't
click
and
i
feel
arts
will
be
a
major
thing
in
that
because
when
i
was
incarcerated
i
had
somebody
they
looked
into
and
brought
up
my
strengths
and
appreciated
that
in
me
and
in
that
little
thing
right
there
as
well
kept
further
incidents
from
happening
a
lot
of
these
times
we
hear
about
you
being
bad
and
these
incidents
occur
in
but
we
don't
know
the
dynamic
does
being
amongst
that
probation
officer
and
not
used
to
begin
with
so
like
a
lot
of
times
it's
put
into
use
but
it's
really
the
probation
officer
going
through
their
own
problems
and
would
not
so
i
wanted
to
touch
on
that
and
yeah
more
arts
man
thank
you
good
afternoon
dominique
non
from
the
children
's
defense
fund
california
i
want
to
first
appreciate
the
work
at
clearly
went
into
developing
this
plan
where
we
hear
the
highlighted
concern
with
a
major
piece
of
the
plan
i'm
going
to
hopefully
with
the
idea
that
would
be
examined
more
closely
moving
forward
and
that
is
the
request
for
significant
additional
resources
both
for
staffing
and
for
the
long-term
not
short-term
facility
structural
renovations
and
the
overarching
concern
we
have
with
the
requests
the
potential
lack
of
alignment
with
the
positive
shifts
that
this
county
has
done
to
reinvest
in
ways
to
support
our
youth
most
effectively
in
their
own
communities
and
those
are
reflected
in
both
the
camp
closures
and
hall
closures
and
youth
development
department
now
more
specifically
the
concerns
are
twofold
one
is
the
additional
staff
request
that's
an
ongoing
through
two
point
five
billion
request
the
other
is
undetermined
amount
of
funds
not
so
not
included
in
thirty
million
dollar
request
for
long
term
structural
changes
and
this
is
the
idea
that
i
think
greatly
reflects
the
lack
of
alignment
with
current
movements
so
today
we
are
requesting
that
the
sport
future
examine

funding
thank
you
next
bigger
blues
good
afternoon
supervisors
my
name
is
norm
johnson
executive
director
of
the
association
of
probation
supervisors
this
is
a
robust
plan
and
we
agree
with
it
however
there
is
a
process
and
the
chief
speaks
of
process
frequently
we
have
not
had
a
meet
and
consult
on
this
plan
and
i
am
here
today
to
say
that
while
we
supported
we
still
need
to
meet
and
consult
on
this
while
we
work
in
towards
this
robust
plan
thank
you
thank
you
next
speaker
please
i
am
in
favor
of
this
plan
but
as
seen
one
thing
you
need
to
put
your
effort
is
to
train
those
young
men
so
they
are
something
to
look
forward
when
you
get
out
and
i
think
to
spend
some
time
or
so
will
keep
them
busy
and
less
likely
to
misbehave
such
my
you
know
and
also
maybe
now
that
the
doctor
magali
is
gone
those
use
will
get
their
medication
becaus
sign
of
the
problem
they
were
not
getting
psychiatric
medication
so
make
sure
that
stone
's
IQ
thank
you
next
picture
please
yes
like
county
board
supervisor
catherine
barger
said
spare
the
rod
and
now
we've
created
monsters
now
you're
the
experts
and
look
what
you've
created
i
am
i
am
opposed
to
using
pepper
spray
on
these
children
they're
actually
monsters
what
they
need
is
a
good
kick
in
the
butt
teach
him
some
manners
morals
and
values
and
hard
ass
military
discipline
and
raise
these
children
like
human
civilized
individuals
and
no
doping
stuff
that
doping
up
these
kids
and
make
him
dumb
dumb
in
catatonic
twits
know
we
need
these
kids
to
be
civilized
functional
and
assets
to
society
so
give
him
a
good
kick
in
the
butt
i
got
it
a
nonfunctional
i
may
be
homeless
but
i'm
functional
and
i
believe
that
these
kids
you
are
depriving
their
innate
abilities
by
doping
them
up
and
that's
a
crime
and
that's
a
sin
so
hell
no
dope
and
get
those
kids
on
a
good
kick
in
the
butt
get
him
to
work
and
get
him
to
function
structures

him
some
structure
and
teach
him
some
love
laughter
joy
and
peace
and
love
speaker
please
good
afternoon
supervisors
and
staff
joe
mazlish
marriage
and
family
therapist
and
i
guess
i
should
add
here
for
a
year
subcontractor
for
the
probation
department
conducting
adolescent
counseling
sessions
for
adolescents
and
training
psych
interns
in
doing
that
i
appreciate
of
course
the
efforts
of
everybody
it's
important
to
underline
a
couple
of
things
super
fries
so
at
least
talked
about
continuing
community
involvement
just
like
there
was
during
the
print
period
i
think
it's
gotta
continue
it's
going
to
be
the
strength
of
this
one
of
the
big
legs
of
this
program
is
going
to
stand
on
and
the
envy
lifetime
the
continuity
of
service
that
supervisor
barger
mentioned
we
doing
this
really
too
in
a
way
to
relieve
the
suffering
of
the
young
people
but
i
want
to
point
out
something
that
yeah
goes
without
saying
goes
on
farther
with
saying
and
that
is
this
is
alternatives
to
incarceration
for
adults
isn't
it
thank
you
this
is
life
long
service
thank
you
back
speaker
place
good
afternoon
to
achieve
fun
i
like
this
program
right
here
and
i
like
the
training
the
treatment
and
a
village
without
the
village
you
have
nothing
else
to
sustain
this
mental
illness
and
we
also
should
be
working
with
the
parents
as
well
because
that's
part
of
the
village
we
gotta
go
in
and
trained
appearance
how
to
cope
with
this
then
really
help
their
children
so
it
be
self
sufficient
without
the
village
you
lost
the
battle
so
you
know
my
thing
is
training
treatment
in
the
village
with
their
parents
and
things
like
that
also
that
most
of
most
of
the
people
that
mental
eel
coming
from
single
parent
homes
and
things
like
this
so
we
are
re
evaluate
that
and
just
please
take
care
of
the
kids
the
kids
are
very
important
in
the
red
chief
on
so
on
repeated
basis
the
harm
has
been
caused
and
that
is
because
reasonable
modifications
necessary
to
avoid
the
whole
situation
is
discrimination
in
violation
of
these
children
's
rights
under
title
II
of
the
ad
act
of
nineteen

OK
next
speaker
please
and
by
the
way
just
remind
everybody
and
again
we
know
you
have
first
amendment
freedom
of
speech
there
are
children
in
the
audience
today
many
kids
are
off
for
the
summer
and
have
decided
to
come
down
and
watch
their
government
at
work
just
going
to
remind
you
of
that
OK
next
speaker
please
yes
i
love
her
member
that
i
agree
but
we
do
we
have
freedom
of
speech
but
we
have
to
uh
this
is
actually
creating
that
a
healthy
mind
again
i
believe
that's
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
it's
also
creating
masochistic
divent
a
depraved
children
again
that
is
increasing
the
recidivism
or
maintenance
of
of
this
class
system
because
abused
children
then
become
abusers
so
they're
entering
the
system
other
being
abused
money
have
come
from
environments
where
they've
been
molested
they've
been
abused
traumatized
beyond
maybe
some
of
our
conceptions
especially
the
foster
care
children
so
they're
breaking
them
down
many
have
been
misdiagnosed
their
medicated
and
then
their
categorize
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
not
to
mention
that
but
then
they
are
tortured
because
this
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
so
again
they
should
be
love
they
should
be
counseled
and
they
should
they
need
prayer
but
this
is
not
what
they
need
thank
you
doctor
melody
time
yeah
so
it's
not
rocket
science
that
abuse
kids
don't
need
more
abuse
but
what
i
find
very
hilarious
is
that
you
have
jack
kemp
who
worked
for
the
county
for
over
thirty
years
and
he
has
no
idea
who
saatchi
how
my
is
are
we
listening
you
have
a
county
staff
member
that
don't
know
who
your
chief
officer
is
so
if
they
don't
know
who's
internally
working
with
them
how
to
hell
they
going
to
solve
problems
for
our
kids
outside
just
saying
we're
tired
of
giving
mitchell
terry
mcdonald
regal
beavis
bingham
is
that
his
name
did
i
say
right
bingham
rives
he
has
a
very
funny
name
the
point
is
these
are
the
same
people
that
got
answers
along
time
ago
on
how
to
reduce
problems
especially
with
at
risk
youth
and
are
not
being
respected
so
why
are
we
going
to
listen
to
this
hour
and
a
half
of
deliberation
how
to
figure
out
how
to
fix
something
jack
camp
needs
to
know
who
has
satya
my
is
far
too
thank
you
jack
kemp
thank
you
we
have
another
person
to
call
up
patricia
mcallister
please
come
forward
youtube
OK
hello
thank
you
hi
i
am
the
person
the
teacher
who
taught
in
these
camps
kilpatrick
eastlake
kirby
i
go
on
and
off
of
two
thousand
five
two
thousand
ten
if
it
wasn't
for
the
staff
and
security
and
the
guards
teachers
would
be
raped
and
assaulted
OK
they
would
sit
outside
our
classrooms
i've
been
hit
in
the
back
with
a
chair
before
had
the
lights
turned
off
on
me
and
could
have
been
assaulted
but
i've
run
pretty
fast
and
i
got
out
of
there
so
i
can
tell
you
is
dangerous
you
spend
the
day
up
in
there
i
did
it
for
two
thousand
five
two
thousand
ten
i
called
him
and
said
i
don't
want
to
have
anything
else
to
do
with
camp
seymour
stayed
with
la
USD
because
the
teacher
was
almost
assaulted
student
told
her
he
want
the
raper
she
reported
to
the
principle
he
thought
it
was
a
joke
this
was
at
kilpatrick
so
when
i
heard
when
she
told
me
that
i
said
i'm
out
of
here
we
get
no
more
support
i'm
not
going
to
have
these
kids
assaulting
me
so
we
need
to
be
protecting
probation
now
here's
another
thing
eighty
percent
of
the
students
of
la
USD
and
throughout
this
state
are
illegal
alien
hispanics
agents
and
filipino
that's
what
we're
talking
about
very
few
african
americans
so
we're
talking
about
criminals
who
are
already
criminals
these
kids
and
we
need
to
backup
probation
kill
three
of
the
members
of
public
that
have
signed
up
on
this
item
OK
um
those
are
all
the
speakers
for
this
item
so
S
one
is
before
us
move
by
supervisor
kewl
and
seconded
by
supervisor
mark
ridley
thomas
to
receive
and
file
this
item
think
about
him
too
if
there
are
no
objections
unanimous
vote
that
will
be
the
order
please
no
yelling
from
the
audience
arnold
i
you're
not
signed
up
on
this
item
yeah
OK
so
now
we're
two
item
twenty
eight
eh
the
impact
of
automation
on
good
paying
jobs
colleagues
i
brought
this
forward
for
the
county
to
begin
to
pay
attention
to
this
issue
an
weigh
in
on
this
issue
and
i
know
i
don't
have
to
tell
you
but
our
ports
have
long
been
a
huge
asset
really
not
just
to
the
harbor
area
but
to
the
entire
county
of
los
angeles
and
dare
i
say
the
state
of
california
and
california
i
think
one
out
of
every
ten
jobs
in
our
region
is
connected
to
the
goods
movement
industry
and
it
has
long
been
a
source
of
good
middle
class
jobs
that
have
supported
generations
of
families
and
have
interned
driven
successful
local
businesses
in
our
region
everything
from
grocery
stores
to
restaurants
to
all
the
small
businesses
in
an
area
really
are
supported
by
these
good
paying
jobs
these
jobs
have
allowed
people
to
buy
homes
and
their
kids
to
college
an
really
be
what
everyone
sort
of
associate
's
with
the
american
dream
and
i
think
we've
taken
these
jobs
for
granted
we
just
figured
these
jobs
would
be
there
as
long
as
our
ports
are
there
an
as
long
as
goods
movement
continues
to
increase
in
our
country
the
last
week
the
harbor
commission
in
los
angeles
voted
to
allow
a
plan
to
move
forward
that
would
automate
some
of
the
operations
at
the
APM
term
terminal
and
everyone
has
begun
to
be
worried
about
what
a
possible
move
towards
automation
would
mean
for
the
future
of
good
paint
jobs
at
airport
and
the
ripple
effect
that
that
could
have
on
jobs
across
the
region
so
my
emotion
today
seeks
to
do
two
things
one
i'm
going
to
ask
my
colleagues
to
sign
on
to
a
letter
to
the
mayor
of
los
angeles
and
to
the
los
angeles
city
council
supporting
the
aisle
WS
efforts
to
oppose
automation
and
two
asking
the
CEO
's
office
to
work
with
la
los
angeles
the
economic
development
corporation
to
conduct
an
economic
analysis
of
the
impact
of
port
automation
that
the
impact
it
would
have
on
local
job
losses
and
to
report
back
to
us
in
ninety
days
and
really
sort
of
wanted
to
broaden
this
a
bit
too
look
at
the
future
of
automation
in
a
lot
of
our
industries
by
the
way
not
just
at
the
port
we
know
every
time
there
pops
up
a
self
checkout
line
in
any
of
our
grocery
stores
or
target
or
any
other
retail
we
know
that
the
corporations
are
looking
to
lay
people
off
and
to
try
to
conduct
business
without
the
use
of
human
beings
and
again
all
these
jobs
means
something
to
the
person
that
has
them
mean
something
to
their
family
and
at
some
point
i
think
we
need
to
take
a
look
at
while
corporations
will
claim
that
automation
is
more
efficient
and
effective
you
know
i
think
we
have
to
at
some
point
look
do
we
really
want
to
society
full
of
robots
because
that
means
yes
maybe
it's
more
efficient
which
i
would
like
to
have
the
debate
that
i
don't
think
it's
always
more
efficient
lots
of
times
automation
equipment
breaks
down
but
you
know
where
are
we
going
to
stand
in
terms
of
protecting
good
paint
jobs
that
fuel
our
economy
that
allow
people
to
have
dignity
support
their
families
and
live
in
our
society
and
i
think
it
some
point
we
might
need
to
just
take
a
far
reaching
look
at
the
fast
moving
pace
of
automation
in
all
sectors
of
our
society
and
see
whether
or
not
we
looked
at
this
and
seen
what
it
might
mean
to
our
overall
economy
so
that's
what
this
motion
is
today
colleagues
and
i
just
think
it's
time
for
the
county
to
pay
attention
to
this
and
weigh
in
on
what
it
means
to
taxes
again
everything
that
a
person
contributes
to
los
angeles
county
could
be
taken
away
if
a
robot
replaces
their
job
in
the
future
thank
you
do
we
have
members
of
the
public
that
have
yes
i'm
done
yes
with
the
following
individuals

situation

terminal
operator
doing
business
in
the
portal
los
angelus
is
chosen
to
implement
a
completely
automated
terminal
at

this
project
has
been
discussed
in
front
of
the
board
of
harbor
commissioners
in
january
i
spoke
about
the
impacts
at
the
harbor
commission
meeting
and
i
urge
the
board
of
harbor
commissioners
to
look
into
this
project
farther
just
yesterday
a
very
interesting
news
article
came
out
in
the
journal
of
commerce
stating
all
the
facts
that
i
put
on
the
table
at
that
time
a
four
in
terminal
operator
shouldn't
enjoy
all
the
benefits
economic
benefits
of
automating
the
terminal
indiana
impact
report
that
was
done
on
trade
pact
terminals
when
they
automated
a
small
portion
of
their
terminal
back
in
twenty
fourteen
the
impact
report
said
that
eighty
five
the
long
short
incomes
are
in
san
pedro
wilmington
are
eighty
five
percent
higher
than
the
medium
income
of
the
local
communities
i
support
your
motion
for
an
economic
impact
report
to
be
done
and
i
appreciate
your
support
thank
you
thank
you
canon
county
supervisors
my
name
is
shannon
ross
i
serve
as
an
executive
officer
on
the
coastal
san
pedro
neighborhood
council
i'm
also
a
delegate
to
the
county
and
state
democratic
party
i'd
like
to
thank
supervisor
hahn
for
bringing
up
this
concern
and
the
rest
of
the
supervisors
for
hearing
this
important
issue
today
i
stand
before
you
to
tell
you
that
our
community
is
scared
we're
scared
of
the
impact
of
the
loss
of
good
paying
jobs
will
have
on
our
local
economy
we
are
scared
that
small
business
owners
will
lose
their
businesses
in
turn
laying
off
their
employees
we're
scared
that
our
property
values
will
drop
and
we
will
see
mass
foreclosures
and
or
increase
in
homelessness
in
the
area
i
am
scared
because
my
husband
works
on
the
docs
and
i
don't
know
how
we
could
possibly
afford
our
mortgage
if
he
lost
his
job
today
supervisors
our
community
my
family
we
are
right
to
be
scared
these
jobs
are
important
to
everyone
not
just
the
union
members
our
entire
community
will
be
egregiously
impacted
county
supervisors
i
ask
you
today
to
stand
for
labor
sandwich
at
fifty
plus
legislators
who
are
supporting
this
labor
action
all
the
local
neighborhood
councils
who
are
supporting
in
standing
with
labor
and
the
los
angeles
county
democratic
party
who
is
also
taking
a
position
to
stand
with
ILWU
labor
please
join
them
and
urged
the
los
angeles
city
council
and
the
mayor
to
take
action
please
help
us
save
these
jobs
thank
you
thank
you
next
speaker
please
thank
you
it's
eric
preven
from
the
third
district
an
this
is
a
very
serious
issue
that
the
port
of
los
angeles
is
now
the
kind
of
arrowhead
you
know
dealing
with
this
because
across
america
automation
is
being
rolled
out
all
over
the
place
and
people
who
perform
jobs
behind
trucks
and
other
equipment
and
things
like
that
are
going
to
be
disenfranchised
completely
and
the
idea
of
what
to
do
about
that
has
become
the
subject
of
one
of
the
presidential
candidates
name
andrew
yang
who
is
a
guy
who
believes
that
we
need
to
be
prepared
for
this
because
when
those
automations
are
rolled
out
the
people
are
going
to
need
some
kind
of
universal
basic
income
and
that
the
dividend
on
all
the
savings
of
doing
things
without
labor
is
great
for
who
for
the
companies
that
push
people
out
of
jobs
no
for
the
people
so
then
those
people
have
been
pushed
out
of
jobs
need
to
be
given
some
opportunity
and
some
i
don't
know
if
a
check
is
the
right
answer
but
something
and
this
is
a
major
issue
so
i'm
glad
you
bring
it
forward
so
we
know
where
these
jobs
are
going
they're
going
out
of
business
but
for
the
record
violations
of
first
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment
an
article
section
two
of
the
california
constitution
regarding
enforcement
of
unconstitutional
decorum
rules
well
i'm
not
going
to
step
up
to
your
civility
of
decorum
rules
i'm
going
to
go
by
what
free
speech
is
about
and
no
way
is
anyone
going
to
monitor
my
free
speech
my
expression
to
protect
the
welfare
of
jobs
the
welfare
of
our
community
and
support
the
committee
as
an
advocate
i
find
it
horrible
that
the
action
of
the
chair
suppresses
us
the
public
from
not
criticizing
an
unfortunately
using
intensive
fires
to
talk
about
the
bullshit
as
going
on
at
the
port
yes
people
are
going
to
lose
their
jobs
but
it's
a
sacrificed
at
the
mayor
that
console
the
city
wall
sensors
has
done
purposely
to
bring
harm
to
the
public
's
interest
and
employment
next
speaker
please
the
red
chiefland
let
me
apologize
for
their
common
things
like
that
um
janice
you've
always
done
a
great

protecting

just
only
two
thousand
seven
thursday

where
you
had
got
people

important

so

be
trained

job
also
and
if
you
have
the
knowledge
you
can
take
more
specific
action
before
it's
too
late
and
people
really
lose
money

my

familiar
with

for
the
levy
of

year
nineteen
twenty
within
county
lighting
district
landscaping
and
lighting
act
one
at
their
previously
approved
rates
for
all
zones
i
have
concluded
that
all
of
these
areas
within
county
lighting
district
landscaping
and
lighting
act
one
will
continue
to
be
benefited
by
the
services
to
be
provided
and
the
assessments
within
the
zones
continue
to
be
spread
in
proportion
to
the
special
benefits
provided
to
the
involved
properties
we've
received
no
written
protests
to
the
proposed
levy
of
the
annual
assessments
for
county
lighting
district
landscaping
and
lighting
act
one
thank
you
thank
you
madam
stacked
bob
through
please
call
the
members
of
the
public
have
signed
up
to
speak
on
this
item
with
the
following
individuals
please
come
forward
when
i
call
your
name
arnold
sax
wayne
spinnler
david
larson
herman
herman
antonio
ramirez
in
red
chief
hunt
oh
boy
go
ahead
oh
we're
getting
one
minute
for
public
hearings
it
now
when
did
this
change
wonder
this
rule
chain
do
we
have
a
corporate
lawyer
working
for
county
council
or
is
this
the
government
lawyer
working
for
county
council
who
made
the
decision
and
how
did
it
change
so
anyway
the
city
has
lighting
districts
also
so
are
these
lighting
districts
i
mean
there
are
districts
go
back
to
nineteen
ninety
six
and
nineteen
ninety
seven
or
proposition
two
eighteen
or
do
these
include
lower
and
by
the
way
where
are
the
lighting
districts
where
they
notified
was
just
posted
that
it
was
going
to
be
hearings
did
you
send
out
mailers
to
all
these
people
that
they
were
going
to
have
hearings
how
did
this
happen
that
nobody
nobody
showed
up
except
some
public
knuckleheads
to
come
and
talk
to
you
about
how
corrupt
the
government
at
the
county
is
that
doesn't
make
sense
people
are
going
to
pay
these
bills
and
they're
going
to
just
get
sucked
in
by
the
way
is
this
unincorporated
areas
or
the
coalition
of
city
areas
because
you
don't
have
thank
you
next
speaker
please
i
guess
it's
probably
because
i
brought
up
about
first
amendment
but
you
see
hearing
on
the
levee
and
collection
another
tax
assessment
to
your
properties
thank
the
department
of
public
works
just
give
a
shout
out
to
miss
mary
siewick
him
because
she
apparently
knows
the
law
federal
title
six
of
the
civil
rights
acts
which
definitely
explains
that
let
us
not
be
excluded
from
participation
and
be
denied
the
benefits
or
be
subjected
to
discrimination
any
program
any
activity
receiving
federal
financial
insistence
along
with
state
assistance
so
no
matter
what
end
or
point
i
get
at
pathetic
and
hopeless
this
is
all
fucked
up
are
those
all
the

that
have
signed
up
on
this

yes
madam

be
appropriate
to
close
the
public

an
vote
on
the
item
item
two
is
before
us
move
by
supervisor
or
solis
seconded
by
supervisor
barger
to
approve
this
item
if
there
are
no
objections
to
unanimous
vote
that
will
be
the
order
the
next

before
you

is
a
hearing

and
no
correspondence

an
there
are
members

was
requested

the
board
on
this
item
now
will
hear
from
the

could
ashian
in
by

chuan
the
members
of

my

deputy

for

the
purpose
of

with
these
proceedings
for
the
preparation
of
the
annual
report
for
fiscal
year
two
thousand
nineteen
two
thousand
twenty
i
have
concluded
that
it's
in
the
public
interest
to
continue
to
collect
the
garbage
collection
and
disposal
service
fees
on
the
tax
roll
since
it
provides
for
the
most
orderly
and
cost
effective
collection
of
the
fees
from
the
affected
property
owners
an
as
recommended
the
continued
collection
of
the
fees
for
fiscal
year
two
thousand
nineteen
two
thousand
twenty
at
its
current
level
is
fair
unnecessary
an
complies
with
the
requirements
of
the
state
law
we
have
received
no
written
protest
to
the
annual
report
or
continued
collection
of
service
fee
on
the
tax
roll
thank
you
thank
you
madam
exact
lobster
please
call
those

public
that
have
signed
up
to
speak
on
this
item
with
the
following
individuals
please
come
forward
when
i
call
your
name
wayne
spinnler
david
larson
herman
herman
antonio
ramirez
jamal
johnson
doctor
ever
ever
mellow
desire
red
chief
hunt
and
nicole
parson
by
shall
not
lie
but
be
denied
the
benefit
of
program
service
under
eric
garcetti
garbage
collection
and
disposal
service
fees
is
it
that
what
the
city
of
los
angeles
has
been
doing
having
a
mitch
match
market
or
garbage
collectors
have
refused
to
pick
up
trash
and
now
the
garbage
the
eyesore
is
out
in
our
community
not
just
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
but
in
the
county
of
los
angeles
when
does
the
garbage
collection
shit
stop
that's
what
people
are
saying
why
is
all
this
shit
in
the
street
sidewalks
have
shit
alleys
have
shit
in
our
streets
have
shit
because
that's
how
i
look
at
garbage
that's
all
i
view
the
fees
for
annual
garbage
collection
so
until
you
clean
up
your
app
maybe
i'll
come
back
to
this
ability
of
life
and
not
act
like
an
asshole
sheila
Q
let's
go
to
lancaster
now
hey
hi
hi
hi
well
what
i
was
talking
about
the
waste
garbage
i
have
right
here
just
one
of
the
draft
this
is
all
i
guess
deconstruction
D
congested
congested
plan
and
it's
for
the
jobs
because
it's
old
drafts
and
drawing
this
one
it
has
the
any
cube
and
then
there's
a
sewage
that
leaves
out
of
animal
valley
hospital
mister
mississippi
and
he
wants
to
do
a
hostile
and
well
i
was
exploring
the
flows
that
we
send
our
waters
ann
yeah
the
sewage
goes
out
this
way
and
it
goes
this
way
water
comes
in
this
way
from
the
freeway
and
so
let's
say
like
scenes
will
be
right
here
sewage
the
drains
would
be
right
here
and
then
but
there's
a
new
way
of
we
do
waste
disposal
thank
you
very
much
OK
one
more
person
to
call
up
would
arnold
saxan
ivan
archery
please
come
forward
hi
go
ahead
OK
thank
you
yes
just
like
there
is
like
human
or
social
capital
i'd
like
to
speak
on
the
cover
experimentation
of
creating
garbage
out
of
people
homeless
people
it's
an
alchemy
specifically
over
medicating
people
using
the
electronic
weaponry
until
your
off
topic
it's
about
garbage
no
it's
specifically
about
it's
a
public
hearing
for
the
fees
well
i
i
think
that
again
people
can
be
viewed
as
either
an
asset
or
liability
in
terms
of
those
that
are
contributing
whether
it's
in
you
know
right
in
in
any
form
so
i
believe
that
this
is
relevant
because
the
system
is
covering
this
up
right
because
people
don't
want
to
be
homeless
in
dysfunctional
so
again
this
is
a
hidden
mind
control
mass
manipulation
to
population
exercise
the
making
of
sewage
garbage
in
dysfunctional
people
right
using
environment
next
speaker
please
go
ahead
my
time
is
started
in
my

one
which

the
evaluation
of
department
heads
specifically
doctor
christina
galley
you
was
aboard
know
she's
committed
several
acts
of
insubordination
she
defied
in
order
of
the
health
agency
head
certified
in
order
from
county
council
she
defined
in
order
from
supervisor
solis
in
doing
so
she
also
defied
the
constituents
that
elected
supervisor
solis
sign
in
her
a
personal
coach
to
somehow
help
her
get
better
when
that
didn't
work
when
she
was
hired
as
the
interim
director
is
throwing
good
money
after
that
especially
since
it's
county
money
this
is
the
woman
who
has
been
in
the
chain
of
command
for
many
many
many
years
if
she
is
now
still
insubordinate
and
had
put
in
writing
i'm
not
going
to
ask
you
too
you
can
fire
me
your
response
should
have
been
we
accept
your
resignation
not
assigning
her
a
personal
coach
thank
you
next
speaker
please
yes
patricia
mcallister
here
and
last
see
i
like
to
speak
on
that
the
increased
employment
opportunities
for
homeless
individuals
so
you
want
to
give
companies
incentives
for
hiring
homeless
people
well
that's
a
good
idea
you
coming
up
with
what
five
six
years
late
that's
a
very
good
idea
we've
got
over
two
hundred
thousand
homeless
people
and
you
just
coming
up
with
that
idea
not
to
be
offensive
to
you
madam
cheer
but
i've
checked
your
congressional
record
out
of
sacramento
and
you
have
nothing
on
there
about
homelessness
or
the
people
it's
about
bosnia
the
scan
act
E
caract
honoring
world
war
two
veterans
i
have
your
record
so
we
need
to
stop
the
elected
these
career
politicians
because
if
you
didn't
do
anything
for
his
back
then
you're
not
going
to
do
anything
today
people
electing
these
politicians
over
and
over
again
because
we
know
their
names
we
need
to
stop
that
starting
likely
people
out
of
your
communities
they
don't
do
their
job
get
them
out
of
office
so
we
get
somebody
who
are
people
oriented
not
career
politicians
and
i'm
not
interested
in
running
i'm
just
navicat
if
i
wanted
to
run
i
believe
i
would
win
OK
now
number
seven
here
a
pilot
program
for
detention
centers
for
women
that's
a
good
idea
lemon
need
jobs
of
course
and
then
you
have
here
you
want
to
get
some
toilets
temporary
toilets
now
what
kind
of
crap
is
that
temporary
toilets
in
hand
washing
we
don't
watch
our
hands
and
use
the
toilet
temporarily
we
used
to
do
it
everyday
this
is
something
that
we
should
be
doing
everything
you
have
temporary
overnight
portable
toilet
in
hand
washing
facilities
you
need
to
focus
on
what's
going
on
out
there
no
reason
you're
not
focusing
because
someone
you
don't
even
live
in
the
city
you
drive
out
here
get
on
the
freeway
you
don't
see
the
homeless
you
just
put
on
your
blinders
you
need
to
get
out
there
and
see
what's
going
on
i
drive
through
the
communities
i
park
my
car
and
walk
through
the
communities
OK
you
need
to
get
out
there
we're
not
going
to
continue
to
allow
you
guys
to
sit
up
in
here
funnel
money
everywhere
except
where
should
be
and
it
should
be
building
affordable
housing
and
we're
going
to
make
this
this
supervisory
commission
here
responsible
youtube
mister
wrigley
young
black
people
on
the
street
OK
next
speaker
players
let
me
remind
people
not
to
shout
out
from
the
audio
supervisors
start
me
over
OK
good
afternoon
supervisor
i
wrote
you
about
this
i
didn't
get
an
answer
you
got
plenty
going
i
know
but
i
thought
i'd
come
and
ask
in
person
and
i'm
sorry
that
supervisor
barger
isn't
here
this
is
about
the
offering
of
the
reward
for
information
leading
apprehension
or
conviction
of
people
in
the
killing
of
her
to
macius
a
ten
thousand
dollar
reward
now
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
at
supervisor
bargers
initiative
there
was
an
award
reward
set
for
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
the
shooting
turned
out
to
be
fatal
the
deputy
was
in
danger
at
the
time
and
i
appreciate
the
fact
that
we
have
our
affinity
's
our
preferences
or
people
we
identify
with
more
readily
than
others
but
to
me
it
just
seems
like
when
it
comes
to
setting
official
policy
that
we
ought
to
leave
that
aside
and
treat
every
issue
and
every
los
as
equal
but
be
willing
to
hear
i'd
be
interested
to
hear
from
your
office
is
as
i
say
i
wrote
last
week
and
speaker
place
my
name
is
anne
rushed
in
i
look
from
sherman
oaks
i
just
wanted
to
urge
you
to
support
item
six
which
is
an
endorsement
of
the
energycap
innovation
and
carbon
dividend
act
this
is
the
very
important
thing
to
get
recognized
and
supported
because
it
is
the
first
act
to
build
to
deal
with
climate
change
that
has
been
introduced
into
the
US
congress
on
a
bipartisan
basis
in
over
a
decade
and
we
want
it
to
be
fully
considered
and
we'd
like
to
have
your
support
for
that
and
i'll
just
also
mention
that
we
had
another
half
dozen
or
so
people
in
support
of
this
message
but
some
of
them
were
not
able
to
stay

beginning
how
many
of
you
here
watched
on
channel
two
sixty
minutes
last
sunday
night

simply
want
to
say
there
was
a
real
good
feature
article
on
sixty
minutes
about
the
children
's
climate
change
lawsuit
against
the
federal
government
for
subsidizing
and
permitting
the
climate
threatening
activity
of
the
fossil
fuel
industries
believe
it
or
not
that
lawsuit
is
still
alive
and
has
at
least
some
chance
of
winning
i'm
seventy
six
but
i
agree
with
the
children
it's
time
we
got
very
serious
about
negative
climate
change
and
the
ways
that
current
federal
policies
contribute
to
that
problem
please
follow
the
children

alternate
enerji
future

known
SC
SEK
four
years
later
there
remains
a
need
to
create
dedicated
housing
for
this
population
when
looking
to
alternatives
to
incarceration
we
must
work
to
ensure
that
there
are
sufficient
housing
options
in
the
community
for
youth
in
the
halls
and
in
our
camps
this
includes
youth
identified
as
csac
there
are
foster
youth
and
youth
in
probate
in
the
probation
system
and
they
are
further
stigmatized
by
being
identified
as
csac
these
children
and
youth
deserved
targeted
services
culturally
competent
support
that
is
in
form
to
the
best
practices
although
the
county
allocated
funding
to
serve
youth
identified
a
csac
housing
allocation
has
not
been
used
for
housing
as
we
see
and
discuss
every
day
we
must
combat
youth
homelessness
by
supporting
youth
in
our
systems

really
thomas
did
you
have
a
motion
to
introduce
thank
you
madam
chair
i
simply
want
to
call
your
attention
to
some
of
the
work
that
has
been
going
on
for
awhile
the
budget
deliberations
just
that
you
recall
our
reference
being
made
to
the
body
worn
cameras
and
at
the
same
time
i
answered
i
made
reference
to
the
issue
of
family
assistance
that
is
a
corollary
to
that
work
of
body
worn
cameras
being
implemented
i
think
it's
important
the
family
who
lose
i
love
one
due
to
fatal
use
of
force
by
law
enforcement
or
while
in
the
custody
be
treated
humanely
an
with
compassion
given
the
recent
fatal
shootings
this
issue
is
more
important
than
ever
before
how
are
family
is
notified
when
a
family
is
notified
by
homer
found
this
notified
and
the
way
they
are
treated
afterward
all
important
factors
and
impacting
the
families
healing
in
the
level
of
trust
that
a
family
and
community
has
in
the
public
safety
agencies
the
law
enforcement
entities
the
county
began
looking
into
this
after
hearing
directly
from
community
based
organizations
and
grieving
families
about
their
experiences
with
the
sheriff's
department
noting
that
trump
uniform
approaches
for
these
families
have
positive
impacts
and
benefits
and
late
two
thousand
and
sixteen
to
office
of
the
inspector
general
requested
the
newly
forming
civilian
oversight
commission
take
this
matter
up
and
so
the
CL
see
created
a
committee
that
diligently
looked
at
best
practices
and
identified
systemic
issues
that
prevented
clear
timely
and
trauma
informed
interactions
with
families
last
fall
surprise
seculin
i
authored
emotion
to
advance
the
CL
CS
recommendations
and
create
a
plan
for
implementation
CEO

just
reported
back
with
the
recommended
steps
for
implementation

noun
time
for
the

very
important
issue
and
this
is
emotion
quoted
by
a
supervisor
kewl
to
be
heard
on
the
ninth

this
of
july

it
will
establish
a

elements

health
to
be
primary
points
of
contact
for
grieving
families
and
help
our
families
navigate
county
processes
and
received
services

create
a
multidisciplinary
team
to
ensure
families
received
timely
information
lossless
tab
lizum
means
to
assist
families
with
paying
or
burial
cost
and
empower
the
department
of
public
health
to
provide
trauma
informed
responses
to
the
larger
community
including
counseling
for
witnesses
to
such
an
incident
i
know
this
issue
is
of
great
importance
to
us
all
and
i
wanna
thank
supervisor
cool
for
her
collaboration
and
bringing
this
forward
would
now
like
to
turn
this
over
to
her
for
comment
but
this
is
about
compassion
in
the
face
of
crisis
and
if
we

i
think
we
will
all
be
better
for
it
thank

i'm
chess
supervisor
surprise
are
killed
thank
you
very
much
and
thanks
so
much
to
supervisor
ridley
thomas

this
we

all
kind
of
talked

several

how
concerned
we
were
that
many
times
of
families
of
those
who
have
been
you
know
shot
lose
have
been
killed
can't
get
any
information
can't
from
whether
they've
been
taken
to
the
morgue
whether
they're
in
a
hospital
etc
this
is
simply
a
way
without
any
judgment
about
any
of
the
circumstances
of
allowing
families
to
at
least
say
goodbye
or
to
know
at
least
physically
where
son
or
brother
or
father
has
been
taken
so
i'm
very
pleased
to
coauthor
this
and
hope
that
it
will
be
seen
favorably
in
two
weeks
thank
you
so
much
OK
thank
you
and
then
um
yeah
another
one

today
you
thank

think
several
of
you

seen
in
the
newspaper
the
hit
and
run
fatality
of
kennedy
bolotsky
a
ninety
one
year
old
survivor
of
the
holocaust
who
was
walking
his
dog
near
the
intersection
of
magnolia
boulevard
in
wilkinson
driver
in
a
white
truck
heading
east
on
magnolia
plowed
into
him
and
he
was
inside
a
marked
crosswalk
motorist
just
drove
away
without
rendering
any
aid
without
stopping
or
anything
as
a
result
of
the
collision
mister
bolotsky
was
transported
to
a
local
hospital
where
he
later
passed
away
LAPD
department
traffic
investigators
really
need
the
public
's
assistance
to
locate
the
truck
and
identify
the
driver
i
therefore
move
that
the
board
of
supervisors
offer
reward
in
the
amount
of
ten
thousand
dollars
in
exchange
for
information
leading
to
the
apprehension
and

responsible
for
the
fatal
hit
and
run
collision
of
